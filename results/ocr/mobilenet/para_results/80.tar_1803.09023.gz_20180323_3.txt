KAZUHIRO ICHIHARA, MAKOTO OZAWA, AND J. HYAM RUBINSTEIN FIGURE 1. Claim 2. There are no compressing disks for Su NM+ in Hp. compressing disk for Sp OM+ in H, appears for t' > t. Proof. If such a compressing disk exists in Hp, then there exists a compressing disk in St NM+ in H for t < t by Claim 1, contradicting the assumption that the first Thus the side M must be where the first compressing disk in Hp appears at the level t' . That is, Str AM has a compressing disk in Hp. Then, there are no compressing disks for S NM+ in HD, for S is strongly irreducible. Together with Claim 2, we conclude that, for t' > t and t' very close to € there are no compressing disks for Spr NM+ in M+, i.e., Sur NM+ is incompressible in M+. Also, at the level t , there cannot be any compressing disks in S.OM in HO. Because if such a compressible disk exists, then it gives a compressing disk in SpNM in HO by Claim 1, contradicting that St NM does not have compressing disks on both sides. Also, at the level t, there cannot be any compressing disks in S, OM in H, for the first compressing disk for Str OM in H appears for t' > i. We conclude that there cannot be any compressing disks for SOM in M at the level t, i.e., St OM is incompressible in M_ This gives the second case of the Finally the third case occurs when St OM+ has no compressing disk in HO for t very close to i and t < €. In this case, there are no compressing disk for St NM+ in H, for the first compressing disk for Str OM+ in H appears for t' > t. This implies that St OM+ is incompressible in M+. In the same way, St AMhas no theorem. compressing disk in H. Claim 3. There are no compressing disks for St NM in HO. Proof. If such a compressing disk exists for St 0 M in HP, then it extends to a compressing disk in SMNM in HO for t' > Eby Claim 1. This gives a contradiction to the strong irreducibility of the splitting in the case that the first compressing disk at the level t' > i appears in the M+ side . Theretore we conclude that, for t < t and t arbitrarily close to t, there are no compressing disks for either St NM+ or St AM D
