Reid and Kontar: Beam-induced Electric Field Distributions . The density model is very similar to other constant mean background electron density means that we know solar wind density models like the Sitler-Guhathakuna model any changes on the distribution of the electric fields are caused and the Leblanc model except that the density is higher close to the Sun, ground plasma temperature was set to 10 K, indicative of the SObelow 10Ro: The density model reaches 5x 10° cm 3 at the low lar wind core temperature at 1 AU , corona and is more indicative to the flaring Sun, compared to giving a thermal velocity of Nk,Telme = 1.2 X 109 cm s .The 10° cm -3 in the Newkirk model . Following the same approach of Reid & Kontar the detection of Langmuir waves . The spec, we model the spectrum of density fluctuations with a tral index is obtained from the typical observed in-situ electron spectral index -5/3 between the wavelengths of 108 cm and spectra below 10 keV near the Earth .

The high characteristic time broadens the electron beam, a process that would have happened to a extent if our electron beam had travelled 1 AU the Sun. The high density ratio is to ensure a high energy density The fluctuating component of the background plasma, de101.5, 10-2, 102.5, 10-3, 10 3.5 104, 104.5 105 and no fluctuations. Propagation of the beam causes Langmuir waves to be induced after 80 seconds, relating to our choice of T = 20 S. Langmuir wave production increases as a function of time till around 200 seconds after which is remains roughly constant. Figure Eh shows a snapshot of the electric field from the 0 , the electric field has a smooth profile. The increase as a function of time as the range of velocities within the electron beam causes it to spread in space. The electric field is smaller at the front of the electron beam where the number When An/n is increased the electric field shows the 2 L greater to from where N = 1000 is the number of perturbations, no is the of Langmuir waves is induced. initial unperturbed density as defined above, In is the wavelength 4.1.

When An/n = Langmuir waves are treated in the WKB approximation such wave energy density is dependent upon the electron beam denthat wavelength is smaller than the characteristic size of the density and sO is concentrated in the same sity fluctuations. We ensure that the level of density inhomoregion of space as the bulk of the electron beam. This region dicular. geneity satisfies density of electrons is smaller. The background fluctuations are static in time because the behaviour seen from in-situ observations. At An/n = propagating electron beam is travelling much faster than any and higher, the electric field is above the thermal level behind change in the background density. To capture the statistics of the electron beam.

Consequently these Langmuir waves eipy tribution as a function of distance at one point in time. cannot be re-absorbed as the back of the electron beam cloud passes them in space . They are left behind, causing an energy loss to the propagating electron beam Kontar 2013 for analysis on beam energy loss. 4.2.
