k-p theory for 2D TMDCS 3 to the tight-binding description of TMDCS 26 3 34 35 36 37 B8, but this approach suffers from the large number of atomic orbitals that have to be included on each site and the need for bygansbearetnrsgplnotr hopping to account for the variation of the weight of individual atomic orbitals in the band wave functions across the BZ, as revealed by detailed density functional theory modelling . The accumulation of experimental data and the drive towards the implementation of monolayer TMDCS in practical devices call for theoretical models of their electronic properties that are both detailed and compact, containing a limited In this Review, we describe two complementary theoretical approaches that have recently been used to achieve a detailed description of the electronic properties of these materials. One consists of ab initio DFT modelling of the band structure, which has the potential to be accurate. DFT can be combined with transport codes 17 38 39 40 41 421 431 44 or used to calculate optical spectra 15 461 4748, but ab iitio calculations are prohibitively expensive for many practical problems focused on modelling devices and studies of, e.g., quantum dots 4191 . Moreover, magneticfield effects 32 49 511 52 53 54 and certain questions regarding neutral and charged excitons 55 cannot easily be addressed by DFT-based techniques. The second approach uses the k. p methodology , which exploits the symmetries of the system. This approach provides an accurate characterisation of the dispersion of the valence and conduction bands in the vicinity of, e.g., the K and -K points and other points of interest in the BZ in terms of a relatively small number of parameters 60. Magneticfield and spin-orbit coupling effects can also be taken into account in a straightforward way 9. In contrast to DFT modelling, this method is only valid in the vicinity of certain high-symmetry k-space points; however, for those intervals, it enables one to quantify all the essential features of the electronic properties. One can also relate a k-p Hamiltonian to a particular TB model 261 32 34, although it is not necessary to set up a TB model in order to derive a ki p Hamiltonian. Here we present phenomenological k p Hamiltonians derived for all extrema of the bands using the symmetry properties of TMDC atomic crystals, with specific material parameters obtained by fitting them to the DFT band structures of MoS2, MoSez, MoTez, WS2, WSez and WTe2. E The DFT calculations discussed in this Review were # Most of the recent theoretical and experimental work has focused on the properties of MoS2, MoSez, WS2 and WSe2, while MoTez and WTe2 have received much less attention. Bulk MoTez with a trigonal prismatic coordination of the chalcogen atoms exists below 815°C , whereas above 900°C the crystal structure is monoclinic and the material becomes metallic 61 62. Monolayer samples using liquid exfoliation technique have been obtained from a-MoTe2 03, and the optical properties of monolayer 192 the transport properties of few-layer aMoTez 641 191 have been investigated recently, giving a clear motivation to include this material in our review. Bulk WTe2 has an orthorhombic crystal structure, where eight tellurium atoms surround the tungsten atom in a distorted octahedral coordination 65166. Nevertheless, one would expect that it may be possible to grow monolayer WTez with hexagonal prismatic coordination on a suitable substrate. For completeness, therefore, we include this material as well, assuming that its hexagonal number of parameters while still offering an accurate description.
