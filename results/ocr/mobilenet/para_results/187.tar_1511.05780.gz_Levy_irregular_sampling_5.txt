Moreover, let Gep be the class of functions 9 such that X is a compound Poisson process, Ct <C, and The tollowing result which describes the rates of convergence with respect to the prescribed smoothness classes introduced above is a direct consequence of Theorem 3.1. Proposition 3.2. Let K be the sinc-kernel. This is equivalent to stating that FK Let h* be emplicitly defined, as the solution of the minimization equation 11-1,11. Then 2 Let h* be the solution of CA,-a7.0wrp3te-9 1. Then Let h* be the solution of â‚¬2Cg" h -2a CACA. Assume that P > 0 holds an 1 a = 2 The
