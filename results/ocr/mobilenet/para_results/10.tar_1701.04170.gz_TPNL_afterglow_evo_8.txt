NLDSA model for GRB afterglows 9 4. EXAMPLE AFTERGLOWS 4.1. Particle spectra and energy densities In Figure 2 we show the spectra of cosmic rays for all Having explained the Monte Carlo code and the manner in which it is coupled to a hydrodythree models, in the local plasma frame. For the sake of namical simulation to create an evolving afterglow modclarity, the cooled populations that have been swept furel ; we will now present the results from three ther downstream are not test cases. The first two models assume that acceleration given. These spectra were taken just downstream from takes place in the test-particle limit, with few enough the subshock at T 0, to most closely match the spectral particles accelerated that the structure of the shock is indices predicted by analytical work.

In one model, thermal particles are explicitly excluded from the radiating subshock. All particles require several diffusion lengths population, though they contribute to the pressure and of transport downstream before their angular distribuenergy density downstream.

The CR-only case is not intendtrary units. Since upstream escape is negligible , and since the difficulty of is present. The CR-only case is included only because scattering upstream against a relativistic shock means it mimics the standard synchrotron model for afterglow most particles are downstream, the total number of paremission, which ignores the thermal population. It serves ticles in each spectrum is the number of particles swept as a control against which our other two models may be up at a given time step. As such, the spectra are not compared; we are not presenting it as a valid alternative only absolutely normalized within each model: they are All three model afterglows use an upstream ambient designed to reproduce the simple power laws used in magnetic field Bo = 3 mG. This is orders of magnitude the standard synchrotron model for afterglows.
