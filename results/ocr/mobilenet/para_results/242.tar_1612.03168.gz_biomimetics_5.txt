The notation at means the inner outer limit at the boundary of OD. More precisely, for a function w defined on Rd, one has where V is the outward normal unit vector of OD. 2 The boundary conditions over the skin are a bit more complicated , the skin is very resistive and the body is very conductive 2. In other words, one has Futhermore, the skin is very thin: if we denote its thickness by o, we have 49 where L was defined as the body length in Section In D we have shown in the case d 2 that, when 6/L < 1 and ks/kw < 1 1 but Okw is of order one , we have the following effective relation for x E OQ: 0 E 100um < L, 6
