While a is fixed at 2 A-1, B is taken at the three different values 0.1, 0.3, and 1.02 A corresponding to increasing couplings between the R and @ coordinates in the interaction region. Eis kept at 0.5 eV,ji at 0, p at 2/3 amu, m at 1/2 amu and T at 1 A. Ri and R2 are both taken at 4 A, beyond which V is negligibly small and the integrand in Eq. is a constant of motion. The collisional systems resulting from the previous parameters involve strong interferences, as shown by the exact quantum state distributions Pas San displayed in Fig. 1 . Since Ji = 0, we note from Eq. that C1 = 01. For B = 0, there is no coupling between R and 6 and J keeps constantly equal to hji during the collision. Calling t the time to go from Ri to the interaction region and back to R2, we have Using Eq. , we thus arrive at with Pi given by Eq. . From Eqs. , and the fact that t does not depend on 01, we obtain 002 001 Ji is represented in Fig. 2 for B = 0 and the three values previously considered. For B equal 0.1, the coupling is small and 002 Ji slightly oscillates around 1. For B equal 0.3, the coupling is stronger, thus leading to oscillations around 1 of larger amplitude. In both cases, however, 002 801 TJi is found to be positive. Hence, the SC-I and SC-I+ approaches lead 001 8
