4.1 Ti mirror maps from coassociative fibrations Let us begin by analyzing the generalized Ta mirror symmetry map in the context ofTCS G2 manifolds. As the Kovalev CYSX admit mirrors by assumption, by the SYZ argument, these have two T3 special lagrangian fibrations. Let us denote such fibrations by Lz. In the asymptotically cylindrical region of the manifold X 2 R+ X SI X S4, the SYZ special lagrangians must asymptote to Lt 2 S1 X At, where At are the SYZ special lagrangian T2 fibrations within the asymptotic K3s . In particular, they do not extend along the R+ direction. Let us fix the phase of the holomorphic top form on X# such that the SYZ special lagrangians are calibrated as follows I 1. Notice that a special lagrangian L gives rise to a coassociative cycle Mi = SIXL A SI X X if and only ifit satisfies . In particular, therefore, for our special lagrangians Lt we have Now, Equation entails that the four-cyc 3S 1 # = XLt CJ are such that I J which entails these are coassociative submanifolds. Since the TCS glueing diffeomorphism E is such that Mi are glued into a coassociative submanifold M CJ which has the topology of a T, which may become singular along loci in Performing three T-dualities along the Lt SYZ fibres is mapping X# to their mirrors XY by I construction. However, as the SI within the asymptotic CY cylinders are swapped with J. 25
