The Born-Mayer known fact, it turns out that B is the most sensitive pacontribution is a simple exponcatiall-decyang function rameter in our analysis, in the sense that small variations of the core-core separation, motivated by the radial dein B can lead to large deviations in the fitting of the excay of electron wavefunctions for the closed shells. The perimental data. Conversely, the Ashcroft prefactor A is effective interatomic potential reads as not a sensitive parameter, and its values are not crucial In Ref. , it was found that, in order to fit shear modulus and viscosity data of various alloys, values of the Born-Mayer repulsion strength B are required which are between two and three orders of magnitude smaller than the Born-Mayer parameters tabulated for pure metals. This important difference has at least two reasons. One reason is that the Born-Mayer formula used for pure substances in the literature is written a exp-Cr, instead of 2 exp-C, which we use here. Evidently, exp > 1 partly contributes to explain this for the match with experiments. where is the Ashcroft factor , with Rcore being a typical discrepancy. However, the fact that B fitted for multivalue for the atom-specific core radius and Zion the effeccomponent alloys is much smaller than B found for pure tive ionic charge number. Furthermore, ao is the Bohr substances is also due to the so-called radius and is the average ionic core diameter of the effect, whereby the addition of even a small amount alloy, which corresponds to the average size of the ionof different elements with different ionic size and elecized atoms constituting the alloy. The average ionic core tronic structure induces a strongly nonlinear change in diameter is obtained by averaging the respective ionic the inter-ionic potential. When there is an atomic size core diameter of the constituents with their contributing mismatch, this difference intuitively promotes softer reweights given by their volume ratios in the alloy. The valpulsion due to the fact that short-ranged ues for the ionic core diameters of the atoms constituting efficient. Of course there could be other packing important reaThe quantities A and B set the energy scales for the change in anisotropy of closed electronic shell, which also repulsive interaction from the Ashcroft and Born-Mayer make the effective short-range repulsion in alloys being term, respectively. The parameter TF is the inverse of effectively milder than in pure metals. the Thomas-Fermi screening length given by ThomasMayer parameters in Ref. Fermi theory, and its value is known for different types in which the outer electronic structure is pairs clearly much of alloys . We choose a representative value for GTF different from metals, where the atoms are significantly The ionic core diameter a is obtained by a weighted avIII.

However, its typdisordered alloys can be described by an effective interical values are less sensitive to the atomic composition atomic potential given by Eq. with A E 0.3 0.5ev, very similar values typically in the range C = 1.89 mined by the elemental composition of the alloy, whereas The latter cannot be easily estimated from firstcomposition. Furthermore, an even simpler parametrizaprinciples or from literature. Similarly, the prefactor B tion of the interatomic potential was obtained by mapof the Born-Mayer term, can be rigorously evaluated only ping Eq. onto a logarithmic expression with a single, from the exchange integrals of the various overlapping global parameter A, which contains all the information electrons belonging to the valence shells of the two interabout the steepness of the acting ions. This calculation, even in approximate form, ion-ion repulsion. This simpler expression reads as deteruniquely 4.72 A can be kept constant, independent of is not feasible except for simple monoatomic crystals. Hence, both A and B were taken in our previous analysis as adjustable parameters in the mapping between our schematic logarithmic potential and the Aaherol-Born-Miayer interatomic poab initio simulation studies . Consistent with this The mapping between Eq. and Eq. is shown in The main advantage of representing the repulsive part tential. We shall remark that the Born-Mayer prefactor Fig.1, for representative parameters of metallic glasses.
