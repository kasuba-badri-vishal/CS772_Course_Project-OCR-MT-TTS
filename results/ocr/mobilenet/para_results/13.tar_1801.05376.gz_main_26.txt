0E6 ext and every n, there is aword I such that jacl > lelnl and XU E ext; since u contains the factor TU, there is an occurrence of U in u outside the prefix UnHence U occurs in u infinitely many times. Thus u is recurrent and we proved this implication. Now turn to the backward implication. For arbitrary words u,0 â‚¬ ext each of them occurs in u infinitely often, SO we can find a factor of the form wwv. This factor also occurs in u infinitely often, allowing us to find arbitrarily long words a,U such that ruwvy is a factor ofu. Then wwu E ext. Hence we proved the Restivo-Salemi property for Lka Remark 39. Itis worth mentioning that for small binary languages Theorem 37 works in an extremal form. Since 21 + <a S 7/3 implies ext = Fac, the language L2,a trivially has the Restivo-Salemi property; as we know from Corollary 3, all a-power-Iree infinite binary words contain all words of ext as factors. The following conjecture is based on extensive numerical studies. Conjecture 40. All power-free languages satisfy the Restivo-Salemi property. As an approach to Conjecture 40, we suggest the following. Open Question 41. Prove the converse of Corollary 38. References : J.-P. Allouche and J. O. Shallit.
