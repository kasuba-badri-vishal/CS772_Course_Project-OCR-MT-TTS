to anomalous triangle diagram which gives a coefficient of 5/9 to the 2-flavour CME but 2/3 for the 3-flavour CME . It results in a relative CME current difference of 1/6 between 2-flavour and 3-flavour cases. However, because the traditional experimental observable 7 of charge azimuthal correlation include all inclusive charged hadrons, it limits ones to measure the relative difference. Recently, the ALICE collaboration measured the identified hadron triggered charge azimuthal correlation, e.g. kaon-hadron correlation, which enable us to access the favour property of the CME . Another advantage of kaon-hadron correlation is that it can avoid the contamination from P meson decay, which presumedly play a significant influence on the CME observable . In this work, we implement a multiphase transport model to investigate the flavour dependence of the CME. In our previous work, we imported the initial CME-like dipole charge separation to the AMPT model with a constant separation percentage, and found that though the original AMPT model can reproduce 60-70% magnitude of the CME observable Y in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV, an initial charge separation percentage of 2 10% is needed to closely match the STAR data, and demonstrate that final state interactions strongly suppress the initial CME effect . In this work, we will improve our method to study the Y correlators in Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV, by taking two following improvements into account. Firstly, we use a centrality-dependent charge separation percentage which is assumed to be proportional to the magnitude of magnetic field in Pb+Pb collisions, which is more reasonable for simulating the CME. Secondly, we consider both 2-flavour and 3-flavour cases for the initial charge separation to mimic the 2-flavour and 3-flavour CME effect, while we only considered two This paper is organized as follows. We give a short introduction of our model and the method to introduce the 2-flavour and 3-flavour dipole charge separations in Sec. In Sec. we present our simulation results and expand some discussions. Finally, we summarize in flavours of quarks in our previous work . Sec. II. THE AMPT MODEL We implemented the AMPT model with string meting mechanism in this study . The AMPT model, which is a Mote Carlo hybrid transport model, includes four main stages of Relativistic heavy-ion collisions, ie initial condition, parton cascade, hadronization, and hadronic rescatterings. The initial condition, which includes the spatial and momen3
