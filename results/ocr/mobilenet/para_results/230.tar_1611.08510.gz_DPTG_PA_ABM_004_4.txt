This is done in a events occurring outside of standard trading series of 10 initial Monte Carlo steps, in which hours, 9:00 to 17:00, but we consider only liquidity providers place limit orders around quotes with a timestamp occurring in the pean initial price, Pa Pb E Po, with no liquidriod from 9:10 to 16:50 on any particular tradity taker activity present. This corresponds to ing day. This is a result of the fact that the the placement of approximately , listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, A sell market order simply executes and ning at 9:10 on 1 November 2013 and ending results in the removal of the best bid from the at 16:50 on 5 November 2013. This dataset was LOB and a buy market order simply executes also considered in Platt and Gebbie . and results in the removal of the best ask from B.

Unlike Aprovider, 9taker is not fixed, but As previously discussed, we apply the calirather evolves over time.
