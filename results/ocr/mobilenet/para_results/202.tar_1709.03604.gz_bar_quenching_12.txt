Quenching parameters In this section we aim to quantify the star-formation quenching efficiency in our various models and to investigate how the efficiency depends on bar parameters, i.e., strength E, timescale In barred galaxy simulations, star formation decreases not h. We introduce simple quenching parameters. First, we estimate as rapidly after the bar formation in comparison to our standard the quenching timescale ha as an exponential timescale for the simulations. The SFR decreases because the gas is driven to censtar-formation rate decrease: tral regions and converted to stars. In the standard model star formation is suppressed very rapidly right after the bar formation while le in a model where star formation does not depend on the ra ldom motions star formation continues after the bar forma but at lower level decreasing only due to gas consumptio d depletion. Globally, in the case of no converging flow, To make the fit, we did not use the whole time span of the ba mation reduces the star-formation rate by a factor of few simulations, but only the period when star formation is supwhi ch is much slower than in our fiducial runs. At the end of the pressed. The second parameter is the quenching rate 6 which we simulation , SFR is still high: a 3 Mo yr-l for rigid take as the ratio between the maximum star formation rate bebars simulation and a 7 Mo yr for self-consistent run. Even if a fore star formation suppression and its value after the quenching slow and weak decrease in the star formation rate is found also phase: in the models where the converging flow criterion is not implemented, we conclude that the inclusion of random gas motions in star-formation prescriptions produces: a rapid quenching phase Article number, page 13 of 17
