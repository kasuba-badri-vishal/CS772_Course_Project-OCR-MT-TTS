70 In fact, if VS,m € for some Vp S m < Tl, then the PU packet is successfully decoded in slot m; similarly, if yS,m € for some Vp S m < T, then the PU packet becomes connected to the root of the CD graph. Specializing to this case and using , we need to prove the recursion In fact, if VS,n E 1,2, the root is successfully decoded and the full CD potential is released, resulting in The new root of the CD graph becomes Ps E T + 1 , with CD potential USn+1 1, SO that Otherwise, the root of the CD graph remains unchanged, ps = ps, with CD potential US,n+1 US,ns and no SU packets are decoded, SO that Msmt1 I Ms,mIt follows that May 27, 2020 DRAFT
