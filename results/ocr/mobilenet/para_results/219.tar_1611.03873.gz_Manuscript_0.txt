Effective sparse representation of X-Ray medical images Laura Rebollo-Neira Mathematics Department Aston University B4 7ET Birmingham, UK AbstractEffective sparse representation of X-Ray signal informational content decreases if the sparsity of medical images within the context of data reduction is the representation improves -. considered. The proposed framework is shown to render This Communication presents a framework required to represent this class of images at very good high sparsity in the representation of X-Ray medical quality. The particularity of the approach is that it can be images. This is achieved by: implemented at very competitive processing time and low Creating a large redundant 'dictionary' of suitable an enormous reduction memory requirements. in the cardinality of the data set rendering elements for the image decomposition. Applying effective strategies for selecting the particular elements which enable the sparse decomposition The goal is to achieve high sparsity, with high quality reof a given image. I. INTRODUCTION Within the field of medical imaging for diagnosis, construction, at competitive processing time. Comparison radiology generates huge volumes of data in the form of the results arising from the proposed framework with of X-Ray images. Complying with archive provisions those yielded by the traditional DCT or DWT approxilegislation, which may require to store the patient's data mations demonstrates a massive improvement in sparsity. for up to ten years, represents a demanding burden for hospitals and individual radiology practices. Additionally, the prompt distribution of remote radiology reporting is one of the challenges in teleradiology. These matters have led several radiological societies to recommend to use II. SPARSE IMAGE REPRESENTATION irreversible compression "in a manner that is Let's start by introducing some notational convention: visually imperceptible and/or without loss of diagnostic bold face lower and upper cases are used to represent At least for extensive use, the state of the art for lossy respectively. Standard mathematical fonts indicate comimage compression are the JPEG and JPEG2000 standards. ponent, e.g., C E RK is an array of real components, Both techniques belong to the category of transformation c, k 1,...,K, and I € RN.XN, an array of real coding, because are based on a compression scheme that elements, I, i= 1,.,Ni= 1,...,Ny. applies an invertible transformation as the first step in the Restricting considerations to 1-bit gray scale images, process. JPEG uses the Discrete Cosine Transform an image is represented by an array I € RV-XN, the for that purpose and JPEG2000 the Discrete Wavelet elements of which, called intensity pixels, are given by of reducing the non-negligible points in the transformed Within the adopted framework for representations using domain. The transformation we adopt here for the same dictionaries an image I E RN.XN, is approximated by a performance" . one dimension and two dimension arrays, Transform . Both transformations play the role integer numbers from 0 to 2-1. purpose is different in essence. Rather than transforming linear decomposition of the form: the data into an array of the same dimensionality to disregard some points there, we expand the representation K I-CADa k=1 domain and strive in the extended domain. to achieve a highly sparse representation Apart from the perceived advantage of sparse reprewhere each De is an element of RN-XN, normalized to sentations for medical image processing and health inunity, called "atom'.
