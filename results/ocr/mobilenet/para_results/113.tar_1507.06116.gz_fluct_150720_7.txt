We note that cos cos predicts a stronger mixing of the particlehole response from the electron and hole bands than cos + cos as already outlined by Mazin et al. Appendix E: Subtraction of the continuum The fluctuation response is superposed on the particlehole continuum that essentially reflects symmetry-resolved transport properties31 Since the contribution of the fluc tuations is relatively strong here they can be isolated with little uncertainty. The simplest way is to use the continuum at or slightly above the crossover temperature Tr into account the selection rules still work in the Fe-based bands are predomininantly negative and positive, materials. For instance, in either case full cancellation is respectively, as expected already for simple parabolic Explicitly written out, the fermionic loop is given various near nodes on both bands. This result shows found for B2g symmetry24, by22 24,41 Ref. 28. 5 2 where M is the form factor , and and subtract it from all spectra measured below Tr. This Gi is the electron propagator on band 2 = T, X, Y. En was sufficient for ErTe,t2 but created negative intensiis the electronic energy and Q is the energy difference ties in the case of La2-.Sr.Cu0,t, Here, we wish to between the incoming and scattered photons. Expericompare the temperature dependence of the fluctuations mentally, pure symmetries can be obtained from linear to a theoretical prediction and have to improve on the combinations of the response measured at appropriate subtraction of the continuum. To this end we make the polarizations of the incoming and scattered photons Ãªi analytical phenomenology for the Big continuum temperFor illustration purposes the fermionic loop 0 is apThis seems sensible since the proportionality holds for proximated in the hot-spot approximation. Hot-spots the Aig results in the entire temperature range above are regions in momentum space where both k and k: qc TsDw and for the Big spectra above Ty. Fig. 11 shows lie on the Fermi surface . Since the loop 0 the steps and checks necessary for the procedure.

Ify changes sign for different hot spots connected by Qc , , and for Aigs Bign B2gs respectively there will be full or partial cancelation within 0. Full cancelation is observed for the first two orders of Bzg symmetry . In contrast, 7 does not change sign across different hot-spots for the Big channel. Consequently, in Big and B2g the fluctuations are Raman active and inactive, respectively. which obeys Xoomel-0,T -Xome as required The Aig symmetry is more complicated in that the by causality. 01; 0r2, Bi and B2 depend only on doping first order contribution, proportional to cos+ cos t. For a = 0.025 we used a1 0.82379, a2 E -0.00138, upper rOW of Fig. 10, would be as strong as the Bi = -0.00923, and B2 E 0.00028.

If a constant continuum is used of the two orders we analyze the effective mass vertices the fluctuations can be isolated in a qualitatively similar on the Fermi surfaces accumulate rapidly in the presence of twin boundaries shows that the band curvatures corresponding to the Aig where the surface assumes a more polar character. This the band structure, that are the best approximations for more slowly close to Ts. the sensitivity away from resonances, in a way similar to Below Ts the uncertainties increase since surface layers vertex can be seen directly in Fig. 6. Appendix F: Initial slope For being a causal function the Raman response is antisymmetric and, as long as there is no gap, linear around the origin. Then Eq. can be approximated as
