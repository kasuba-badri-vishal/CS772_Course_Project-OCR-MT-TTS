where p is the upper bound of term n Projected at Different Subspaces: Then, we will use mathematical induction to prove It is true when t = 0 since le 15 0. Assuming that equation 160 is true at the tth iteration, we need to prove Applying into RHS of 161 we have and substituting into LHS of , we have Y Then, our goal is to prove RHS of is ater than RHS E . After manipulations, it is sufficient to show In the following, we will show that the above relation is true. First step : We know that where is true because we choose Cmax E 1 and 7 S Cmax/Lmax Second step : Also, we know lat With the above two steps, we have 0 < 4u60+1, which completes the induction. 50
