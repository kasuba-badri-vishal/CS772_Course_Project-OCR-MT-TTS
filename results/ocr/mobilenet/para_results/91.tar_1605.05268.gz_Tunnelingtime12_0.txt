Planck-Star Tumnelling-Tmes an Astrophysically Relevant Observable from Background-Proe Quantum Gravity* Marios Christodoulou", Carlo Rovellio, Simone Speziale", Ilya Vilensky* # A gravitationally collapsed object can bounce-out from its horizon via a tunnelling process that violates the classical equations in a finite region. Since tunnelling is a non-perturbative phenomenon, it cannot be described in terms of quantum fluctuations around a classical solution and a backgroundfree formulation of quantum gravity is needed to analyze it. Here we use Loop Quantum Gravity to compute the amplitude for this process, in a first approximation. The amplitude determines the tunnelling time as a function of the mass. This is the key information to evaluate the relevance of this process for the interpretation of Fast Radio Bursts or high-energy cosmic rays. The calculation offers a template and a concrete example of how a background-free quantum theory of gravity can be used to compute a realistical observable quantity. I.
