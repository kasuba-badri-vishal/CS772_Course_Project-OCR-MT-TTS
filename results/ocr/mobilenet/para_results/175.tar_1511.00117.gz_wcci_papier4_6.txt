VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, a new approach to generate algorithms with chaotic behaviors is proposed. This approach is based on the well-known Devaney's topological chaos. The algorithms which are of iterative nature are based on the so-called chaotic iterations. This is achieved by establishing a link between the notions of topological chaos and chaotic iterations. This is the first time that such an approach is considered for chaotic iterations. Indeed, we are not interested in stable states of such iterations as it has always been the case in the literature, but in their unpredictable behavior. After a solid theoretical study, we consider the practical implementation of the proposed algorithms by evaluating the case of finite sets. We study the behavior of the induced computer programs hash functions. The security in this case is defined by the unpredictability of the behavior of the proposed algorithm. The algorithm derived from our approach satisfies important properties of topological chaos such as sensitivity to initial conditions, uniform repartition , and unpredictability. The results expected in our study have been experimentally checked. The choices made in this first study are simple: the aim was not to find the best hash function, but to give simple illustrated examples to prove the feasibility in using the new kind of chaotic algorithms in Original image.

Application example Let us consider the two black and white images of size proving that it is possible to design true chaotic computer 64 X 64 in Fig. 2, in which the pixel in position has programs. A simple application is proposed in the area of been changed. In this case, our hash function returns: 34AGIDJDFTOC3902F75249CJADEFE2C 9C9538E51 for the Fig. 2 and 5E67 57056FA960B for the Fig. 2. 7B399C999F74CF1CAD F5F30F2D3D 926 67896 Let us consider now the two 256 graylevel images of Lena computer science. In future work, we will investigate other in figure 3, in which the grayscale level choices of iteration functions and chaotic strategies.

In this case, our hash function duced by topological chaos, such as entropy, will be explored and their interest in the information security framework will be shown. REFERENCES 1 J. M. Bahi and S.
