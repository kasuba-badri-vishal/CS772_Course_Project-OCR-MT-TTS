HMC RNS-HMC Figure 6: HMC VS RNS-HMC: Comparing oneand two-dimensional posterior marginals of 01,011, 021, 031, B41 based on the logistic regression model with simulated data. Table 1: Comparing the algorithms using logistic regression models and an elliptic PDE inverse problem. For each method, we provide the acceptance probability , the CPU time for each iteration and the time-normalized ESS. adult dataset which has been used to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year. We reduce the number of features to 60 by random projection . We set the step size and number of leapfrog steps € 0.012, L 10 for HMC and RNS-HMC; € 0.5, L 4 for RMHMC and RNS-RMHMC. All datasets are normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. The priors are the same as before. The results for the two data sets are summarized in Table 1. As before, both RNS-HMC and RNS-RMHMC significantly outperform Another computationally intensive model is the elliptic PDE inverse problem discussed in . This classical inverse problem involves inference of the diffusion coefficient in an elliptic PDE which is usually their counterpart algorithms. 5.2 Elliptic PDE inverse problem 16
