In and we replaced T with Th by using to simplify the expression. Thus, the diffusivities are and the butterfly velocities are Finally, by noticing that TL 1 we have Notice that the Er and Ey depend only on 2 and € irrespective of 0 and Ç. They are also independent of charge density P and momentum relaxations k1 and he2. This universality is nontrivial because the thermal conductivities, specific heat and butterfly velocity, all of To investigate if there is any lower or upper bound of Ea and Eys we need to understand the parameter region of 2 and 6. We will restrict ourselves to positive 2i. Based on the them depend on through . When it Ez and Eys all Lrs Li, L2 and Th are canceled out. allowed parameter region obtained in section we find to the combinations Class I and II where & A2 1 Class I-i 29
