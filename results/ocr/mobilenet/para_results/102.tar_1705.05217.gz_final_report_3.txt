TABLE V MANTISSAS AND EXPONENT PRE/POST PROCESSING COMPLEXITY OF COMPLEX BLOCK ALU of the complex block output. With Exponent Box Encoding in the worst case, we need eight more mantissas post-scaling. Also, the Shift Vectors allow for four possible intermediate exponent values instead of one intermediate exponent value in Let X1 E CIXNI, X2 E CIxN2, and Y â‚¬ CIX be complex-valued row vectors, where * denotes convolution, TABLE VI QAMTRARSMITER, RECEIVER SPECIFICATIONS Common Exponent Encoding. C. Complex Convolution such that, We assume Ni < N2 for practical reason where the model of channel impulse response has shorter sequence than the discrete-time samples. Each term in the complex block output is complex inner product of two complex block input of volution is implemented as complex block multiplication and complexity of mantissas and exponents in Appendix varying length between 1 and min.

SYSTEM MODEL Due to the channel effect such as fading in practice, the received signals will have larger span in magnitude-phase reWe apply Exponent Box Encoding to represent IQ composponse. The Common Exponent Encoding applied on sampled nents in baseband QAM transmitter in Figure 5 and baseband complex block IQ samples is limited to selecting window QAM receiver in Figure 6. The simulated channel model is size of minimum phase difference. The Common Exponent Additive White Gaussian Noise . Table VI contains Encoding must update its block size at the update rate of gain the parameter definitions and values used in MATLAB simulaby the Automatic Gain Control . Instead, our Exponent tion and Table VII summarizes the memory input/output rates Box Encoding could lift the constraint and selects fixed block and multiply-accumulate rates required by discretesize, No = IRX Fsym in this simulation. We simulate matched time complex QAM transmitter and receiver chains. A. Discrete-time Complex Baseband QAM Transmitter We encode complex block IQ samples in Exponent Box Encoding and retain the floating-point resolution in 32-bit IEEE-754 precision in our model. For simplicity, we select block size to be, No ITX faym: The symbol mapper generates a ITX faym-size of complex block IQ samples that shares common exponent. Pulse shape filter is implemented as Finite Impulse Response filter of NTX. -order and requires complex convolution on the upsampled complex block filter of NRX. -order. V.
