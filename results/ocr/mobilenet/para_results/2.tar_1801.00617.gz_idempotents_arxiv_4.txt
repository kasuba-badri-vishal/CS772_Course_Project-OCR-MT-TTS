Variety of idempotents in nonassociative algebras Ver.: Sun 31st May, 2020, 00:175 which is naturally identified with a corresponding element WA E V* 8 V* 8V.If e fe1,.. ,ent is an arbitrary basis in A, where n dimk A, then WA induces a K-quadratic polynomial map VA : K" > K" defined by where € is the coordinatization map e : zes:1 K"A, a =6. K". In this setting, VA is a bilinear map on K", Then an element C € E A is idempotent if and only if the corresponding a € K" is a fixed point of VAlT,, i.e. It is convenient to consider the projectivization of the latter system. Namely, let w2 = VAla, EOT, where X € K"+1, The modified equation is homogeneous of degree 2. By the made assumption on K, we can consider both and as equations over the complex numbers. Furthermore, defines a variety in CP", Clearly, if I solves then X is a solution of , and, conversely, X solves with 2o # 0 then La is a solution of . In the exceptional case 1o 0, one has 0, i.e. € is a 2-nilpotent in A. In summary, there exists a natural bijection between the set P and all solutions of in CP", In this picture, 2nilpotents correspond to the 'infinite' part of solutions of Then the classical Bezout's theorem implies the following dichotomy: either there are infinitely many solutions of or the number of distinct solutions is less or equal to 2", where T dimx A. Therefore if the set P is finite then with 2O 0. necessarily We point out that one should interpret a solution to in the projective sen
