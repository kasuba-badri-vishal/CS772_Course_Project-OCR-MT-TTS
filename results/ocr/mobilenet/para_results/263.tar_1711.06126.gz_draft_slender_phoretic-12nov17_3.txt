4 where II = -m40 in terms of half the length of the swimmer, L. We consider swimmers with concentration gradients generated by the colloids on a scale c*/a. Hence we express the flux J of reactant particles in units of c*D/a, the concentration field C in units of c*, , the interaction energy V in the units of thermal energy kBT, , the flow field 0 with U* = u'c*la molecules with the swimmer surface. We scale the pressure field P with nU*/1. We note that the problem has three length-scales; the swimmer characteristic length 21, its cross-sectional radius a and the range L* of the interaction between the molecules and swimmer surface. Consequently, we have three asymptotic near-field We therefore define the dimensionless parameters, € all, the slenderness ratio and A = L*/L, the interaction layer thickness to the swimmer largest lengthscale, with 0 < 1<€ <1 In addition, we define dimensionless fields J= Ja/c*D, C = c/c*, U 0/U*, P pl/nU*, 2b D/kBT, and the dimensionless catalytic flux a àa/c*D on regions and in addition the scale on which the ends of the rod are rounded. the swimmer surface. where 1 = L*/l is the ratio of the interaction length-scale to half the length of the swimmer, € E a/l is the swimmer slenderness ratio and AIT ES,2 is the short-range interaction potential between reactant molecules and surface. and the concentration decays to its value far from the swimmer, C Coos Vr2+2 00. V The zero torque and force conditions are where II = -m1+? is the dimensionless stress tensor and ds, dV are the surface and volume elements in cylindrical coordinates respectively. ..
