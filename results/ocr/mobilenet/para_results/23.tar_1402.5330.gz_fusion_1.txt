For light and medium systems, f a 1, and almost all the 'capture' events lead to fusion resulting fusion cross sections to be practically 'capture' events ultimately lead to fusion while for the remaining part of the events, the system re-separates prior to equilibration and clear distinction between fusion and capture cross sections then becomes necessary.

CALCULATION AND RESULTS The near-barrier fusion excitation functions of medium and heavy mucleus-nucleus systems have been analyzed using a simple diffused barrier formula derived by folding the Gaussian barsion cross section for a fixed barrier. The same set of target-projectile combinations have been selected for which heavy ion sub-barrier fusion has been recently studied. The values of mean barrier height Bo, width JB and the effective radius RB have been obtained using the least-square fit method. These values are listed 3 in Table-I and arranged in order of the increasing value of the Coulomb parameter 2 EZlAR + A33. Since the number of data points for 48Ca+124Sn is too low compared to other systems, the error bars for Bo , JB and RB are TABLE I: The values of the mean barrier height Bo, the width of the barrier height distribution JB and the effective radius RB, deduced from the analysis of the measured fusion where RB denotes the relative distance corresponding to rier distribution with the classical expression for the futhe position of barrier approximately, which yields CLYt where rather large.

The parameters Bo and JB along with RB is to be determined by fitting Eq. along with Eq. to a given fusion excitation function. In the derivation of formula Eq., the quantum effect of sub-barrier tunneling is not accounted for explicitly. However, the influence of the tunneling on shape of a given fusion excitation function is effectively included in the width parameter OB. The fusion cross section formula of the Eq. obtained by using the diffused-barrier, is a very elegant parametrization of the cross section for a process of overcoming the potential-energy barrier. Hence, it can be successfully used for analysis and predictions of the fusion excitation functions of light, medium and moderately heavy systems, especially in the range of near-barrier energies. The term 'capture' is used to refer the process of In Figs.-1 & 2, the measured fusion excitation funcovercoming the interaction barrier in a nucleus-nucleus tions represented by full circles are compared with the
