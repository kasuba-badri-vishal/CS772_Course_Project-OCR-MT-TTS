4 To overcome this problem we follow the iterative method employed in Refs. 45-48 which is based on the Binder cumulant. As the renormalization group calculations predict infinite-randomness criticality with activated dynamical scaling, the scaling form of the Binder cumulant reads Here T = T denotes the distance from criticality, Xg is a scaling function, and 2b and V refer to the tunneling and correlation length critical exponents.
