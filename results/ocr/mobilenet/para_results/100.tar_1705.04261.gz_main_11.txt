Overlaid the maps in panels , and are in-plane magnetic-field lines and likewise in-plane electric-field lines in panel . The white crosses are intended to facilitate cross-correlation of various details. One example of an ion kinetic trajectory is of ions and electrons , all taken at time t/max 15 in a small region harboring strong turbulence. as white solid line for times tmax < 15 and dashed line for later times.
