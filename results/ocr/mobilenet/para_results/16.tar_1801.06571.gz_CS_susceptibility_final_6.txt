7 Sectors with M = 2, M = 3 are the subsets of diagrams with 2,3, cross-sections in which we split the poles of the Green's functions with equal frequencies and momenta separated by q. In the cross-sections in between the selected ones GG is again approximated by Ga. The contribution from the M = 2 sector is represented by the skeleton diagram in Fig. 5 labeled M 2. It contains fully dressed side vertices AFto and a fully dressed anti-symmetrized static interaction between fermions on the FS. One can easily FIG. 5. The ladder series of diagrams for the static susverify that this interaction appears with the prefactor ceptibility X70. The exact XL is represented as a series Z2, i.e., the extra factor in the M = 2 sector M = 0, 1,2, ofl bubbles comprised of Green's functions with compared to M = 1 is the product of XLO and the correpoles on opposite halves of the complex frequency plane, i.e. sponding component of the Landau function. Using whose contributions are computed close to the FS. pole and a branch cut. A pole can be avoided by closing the integration contour in the appropriate frequency halfplane, but the branch cut is unavoidable, and its presence renders the frequency integral finite. Since there is no splitting, relevant fermionic Wk and k are not confined we then obtain . bubbles. A simple bookkeeping analysis shows that conFermions at such high energies have a finite damping, i.e., tributions from sectors with larger M form a geometric are not fully coherent quasiparticles. By this reason, the series, which transform 1 Erle into 1/. ColM = 0 contribution to AFO is labeled as an incoherent lecting all contributions, we reproduce Eq. . one, XilLa E XiAe . We next move to the M = 1 sector. Here we select the 8. The susceptibility xf at finite 2/07lql. We now extend the analysis to the case when both subset of diagrams with one cross-section, in which we transferred momentum 9 and transferred frequency S2 are pick up the contribution from GG from vanishingly small, but the ratio 2/vrlal is finite. The the range where the poles in the two Green's functions computational steps are the same as for static suscepthe skeleton diagram in Fig. 5labeled M = 1. The sector and the vertex function Apos do not depend on internal part of this diagram gives Zxia, the ratio of 2 and remain the same as in the where XZ,0 is given by . The side vertices contain static case. However, the integrand in the expression for Aroylke, i.e. the product of the bare form-factor pendence via vrlql cos Or/. This , and the makes the computation of series with M 1,2,... more are in different half-planes of complex frequency. The tibility. The contribution to from the M 0 sum of such diagrams can be x0, Eq. , now contains a non-trivial angular decontributions from all other cross-sections, in which involved. GG is approximated by G. These contributions would vanish if we used a static once we include dynamical screening at order U2 and higher. Similarly to the M 0 sector, the difference Apo -1 is determined by fermions with energies of Order EF. Note, however, that in the M E 0 sector, all internal energies are of order Er. In the M m 1 sector, internal energies for the vertices AFo are of order Er, but external Wk are infinitesimally small, and external k are on the FS. Overall, the contribution to the static susceptibility from the M = 1 soctor is Consider first the limit 2 < vrlql. For even 1, the U for the interaction, but again become non-zero free-fermion susceptibility is where 01 = 1 ifl E 0 and a = 2 ifl 2m, m > 0. For odd 7, the expansion in 2 starts with Q2. The total contribution from the M E 1 sector still is proportional to X7,0:
