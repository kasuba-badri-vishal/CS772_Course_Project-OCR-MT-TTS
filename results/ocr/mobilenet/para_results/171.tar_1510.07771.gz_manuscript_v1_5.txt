6 V = Vo + Vsoc, Vo x Vo being the scalar potential and Vsoc = Vr + VR the SOC part of the potential. In the limit where Vo > Vsoc, the solution to Eq. can be written as: where the last expression applies to the large Vo limit. Thus, to leading order, the cross section Dir is determined by the first term of the right hand-side, whereas 7 is determined by the the second term. Hence, y is expected to decrease at large Vo X VO; as shown in Fig. 1. For a given set of Vo, Ar, and ASR, Fig. 2 shows the behaviour of 7 and Xtr as a function of the incident electron energy E at different values of anisotropy parameter B. For the values of B close to those corresponding to the non-standard Rashba SOC . the energy dependence is strongly modified. On the other hand, for the case of a delta function potential, the anisotropy has a less pronounced effect on the cross section Xir The observations made above remain largely unchanged and the associated smearing of the Fermi distribution, smooth out the sharper features of the energy dependence Er of 7 found at T = 0 and suppress the FIG. 3. - Temperature dependence of 7 versus EF plot ferent B.

As shown there, thermal fluctuations the C6v symmetry is broken by the adatom arrangement magnitude of 7. This can be seen in the left panel in within the clusters. Close to B = 1 the deviation from Fig. 3 for case of a pure anisotropic Rashba Rashba and the perfect Cou symmetric situation is small. SOC and on the right for Ar # 0. The plots on the On the other hand, having 1 < B < 0 requires a strong left panel also illustrate that, B = 0 In Fig. 1, we show the dependence of the spin Hall . This angle 7 and the transport cross section Xfr at zero temis because the quantization axis for the spin current is perature on the carrier energy E for different values of aligned along the 2 axis, whereas for B 0, Sy commutes strength of the scalar potential Vo E N0/R2 with the Hamiltonian. As pointed out above for T 0, for a rather anisotropic Rashba-like SOC corresponding the energy dependence , to B E -T/8. It can be seen that the enhancement of is most strongly affected as B approaches I . However, the effect of the anisotropy is of E for which 2t exhibits a peak, that is, a scatless pronounced for B > 0. This conclusion still holds tering resonance. This is in agreement with what was true when the scatterer also induces intrinsic SOC on already pointed out in Ref. 10 for the isotropic Rashba the graphene layer , as it is shown in the near the scatterer and therefore it can also experience tion of a very different energy dependence as B nan I is the effect of the locally induced SOC.

The results for the energy dependence of 7 and Dir are displayed in Fig. 4.
