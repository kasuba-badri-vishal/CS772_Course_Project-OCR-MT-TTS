We claim that 9 is adjacent to p in Ck. Indeed, conditions C1 and C3 hold trivially. To verify C2, consider a curve e â‚¬ S2 touching d at a point in the arc of d from 9 to q. This touching point lies inside T.. However, e must intersect b, SO it must leave T. It touches a, SO it must leave through either bi or c. Here C has fewer than 2a2k points in X, by our choice of i, while bi contains fewer than a2k points in X, since Case 2 does not hold. Hence, e has fewer than 3a2k points where it can leave T, and there are at most 3a2k possible choices for the curve e. This means that condition C2 is satisfied and a is adjacent to p in CkBy our choice of 2, we can select the curve d in at least k/a different ways, each giving rise to a different edge in Ck incident to p. The total weight of these edges is Q. This completes the analysis of the last case, showing that the total weight of all edges in Aks Aks Aks Bk and Ck incident to p Summing over alll possible values of k and over all 72 touching points in T, we conclude that the total weight of G is at least allognn2. Comparing this lower bound with the upper bound proved in the preceding subsection and substituting a Vlogn/log logn, Theorem 7 follows. is at least Q. References P.K. Agarwal, E. Nevo, J. Pach, R.
