Such a large amplification of the ambient magnetic field around SNRs is indeed what has been suggested resonant streaming instability as well as non-resonant, , and on observational grounds, with the interpretation of the extreme thinSNRS as due to the synchrotron losses of the highestHowever, even with such a large field amplification, by a factor of order 100, and even if one assumes that this can be maintained at the appropriate length scale to be fully profitable to particle acceleration, it remains very difficult for DSA to accelerate protons up to 1PeV be very far from what is needed to validate, at least in experimental data on the highest energy cosmic-rays, shows that the GCR sources must be able to accelerate protons at least up to 1017 eV . This is two orders of magnitude higher than what can be optimistically achieved by standard SNRS , even though this may simply be because the acceleration phase during which PeV energies are reached is very short in time. 4.2. The "other source ' solution One solution to save the SNR-GCR connection is to invoke an additional source of GCRS. Basically, the SNRS would account for the GCR spectrum up to the knee, while another type of sources would account for the spectrum above that. This other component couldbe either Galactic, or extragalactic . This does not seem very likely, however, because the matching of the two independent components in a seamless knee-like structure is particularly difficult to achieve in practice . may also refer to Ockham's razor and note that, if another type of sources, still to be identified, is needed to explain the cosmic-ray flux up to the ankle, then there might be no need for SNRs at all , as these new sources might just as well dominate at lower energy too, instead of suddenly starting above the PeV energy range. This would solve the problem of matching two components Another interesting solution to save the SNR-GCR rather than a new type of sources, to fill the gap belution because there could then be no need to match two independent components in a seamless way. If smaller and smaller subset manages to accelerate partiing a Z X 1017 eV or above, the schematic picture presented above would be globally satisfied. The knee would then be the consequence of the reduction of the number of contributing sources rather than an effect of particle propagation in the Galaxy. For instance, the flux of GCRS above the knee gamma-ray bursts, or to SNRs which interact with the Of course, it remains to be confirmed that this "subset solution" is viable in practice, i.e. that some SNRs can indeed accelerate particles up to Z X 1017 eV. Such a demonstration would be a remarkable achievement, and it certainly is an important astrophysical question. According to , in the case of SN 1993J, the proton maximum energy could have been as high as 23 1016 eV, one or two days after the outburst. Although this is still short of what is needed, and although, according to , it does not take into account some nonlinear effects pointed out by which could reduce further the maximum energy, it suggests that the maximum GCR energies could be reached in a few exceptional sources, in some particular cireumstances, SO that the usual limitations pertaining to the most studied SNRS may not be However, while this remains an open question, we wish to point out that the subset of sources needed to account for the whole GCR spectrum should not be a Let us adopt the point of view that all SNRs accelerate protons with a power-law in Eup to the knee, at Einee = 3x1 1015 eV, or above, while only a smaller fraction of SNRS, a, accelerate protons with the same power-law up to an energy E > Eknee or above. What is then the fraction of the SNRS, a, which must accelerate protons up to 1017 eV or above? through a knee. 4.3. The "subset" solution in the last decade, both on theoretical grounds, with connection consists in invoking a subset of the SNRS, CR current driven instabilities . in SNRs. Now, even if it were possible, this would still could be due some exceptional SN explosions or failed principle, the SNR-GCR connection.
