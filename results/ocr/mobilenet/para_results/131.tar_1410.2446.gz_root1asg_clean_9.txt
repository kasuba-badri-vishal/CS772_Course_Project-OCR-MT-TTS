Proof The identity , for d E T= k + 1, is by definition true in the initial seed. Moreover, the exchange polynomials 09.... ,001 are exactly the ones that appear in a standard cluster algebra of type C, and they are unaffected by mutation : indeed, only the monomials uf change, in accordance with the mutations of the exchange matrix. Therefore, cluster variables that do not correspond to diameters behave the same way as in a standard cluster algebra of type C, as described in . The proof for the first case is thus similar to those found in The second equation , for k = T 1, is also by definition true in the initial seed. Since every cluster contains exactly one variable of the form Ea,a: and any mutation of a variable Waa yields a variable corresponding to another diameter, we can deduce from the initial cluster that all variables Laa are linked by a mutation in direction T. In the initial cluster , we have 3 and . The general relation 2.16 can be obtained directly in the following cluster Indeed, recall that 00 is unaffected by mutation, SO that in order to understand Hns it is enough to know how the matrix B mutates, namely in the standard way . This determines the variables Tab appearing in the monomials 117 and ln in the mutated cluster above, thus yielding 10
