at the LO QCD corrections can be found from Eq. . Since Q1,2 mix with the QCD and EW penguin operators, i.e. Q3-10, we basically need the 10 X 10 ADM matrix for the operators Q1 10Since the mixture of Q1,2 and Qs 10 is dominated by the QCD penguin operators, we adopt the F6 ADM for the new physics effects, and theATM is given as : with J being the number of flavors. If we take the operators Q1-6 as a basis, from Eq. , the corresponding Wilson coefficients can form a vector and be expressed as CT = 667 and Ct E 08 at the MHs scale. Using RG evolution with ADM in Eq. , the Wilson coefficients at the mc scale can be obtained as: where we have ignored the eftects that are less than or around E0.1, and Cy can be Similarly, we can apply the same approach to the Ofetl operators. From the HamilCSLLy 01 and C"SLLu C68. Using the ADM in Eq. , the obtained from CT using CRe instead of GAf. tonian in Eq. , the Wilson coefficients at the P Wilson coefficients at fl E Mc can then be obtained as: MH3 scale can be formed as We can obtain CISLL from CSLL" using COR instead of CE. Following Eqs. and and using the introduced matrix elements, the Refrom the tree-level diquark contributions can be formulated as: 23
