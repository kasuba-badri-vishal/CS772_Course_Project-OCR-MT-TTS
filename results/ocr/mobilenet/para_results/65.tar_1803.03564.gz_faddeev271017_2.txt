As in Ref. , let us consider the five-point correlation function with one degenerate field Due to the presence of the degenerate field, this correlation function satisfies a partial differential equation, second order in 2, first order in I. For the purposes of this section it is convenient to define the function W as is the elliptic integral of the first ki d and 01 is the Jacobi theta tunction . The function W defined doubly periodic potential Eq. satisfies non-stationary Schrodinger equation with where the potential V is given by and the parameters Sk are related to the parame ers Olk 3 In Eq. f is the WeierstraB elliptic function with periods TT and TT defined by the infinite sum 3
