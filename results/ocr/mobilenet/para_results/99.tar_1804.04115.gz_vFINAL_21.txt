MCF WITH SURGERY FOR LOW ENTROPY HYPERSURFACES 22 Since by lemma 2.5 the entropy for a compact hypersurface will be attained by an F functional centered in its convex hull, without loss of generality 2o is in the convex hull of M#. Since for such 2O we have a -Tol < D <0?, we see for a lower bound C on T we have Ve 4r IS 2 <0 for any choice of C E Mr. Denote this We also note similarly for T > C that the Gaussian weight of a Fror functional is bounded below by e 4c > 0; denote this lower bound by a. Also denote by Maot and Mzosr the minimum and maximum respectively -12-2012 upper bound by p. -D? of the Gaussian weight of Frot in Ue. Then the following is true: Since O > 0 and P < O we can make this quotient as close to one as we like by making Te sufficiently small; in other words we can make the ratio of the minimum to the maximum of the weight in these F functionals as close to 1 as we want in Ve by increasing HneckSwitching to the translated and rescaled picture the ratio persists under rescaling, ve have for t0 â‚¬ Ur and for T > C1 the following: 2of course, the diameter is decreasing under the flow SO is uniformly bounded by the diameter of the initial time slice
