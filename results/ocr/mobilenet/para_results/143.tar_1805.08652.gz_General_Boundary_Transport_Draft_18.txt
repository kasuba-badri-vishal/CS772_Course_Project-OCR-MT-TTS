BOUNDARY LAYER OF TRANSPORT EQUATION 19 Us ng the trace theorem, we nave 3.19 Also, we obtain Collecting terms in , , , and , we obtain Then this naturally implies 1 at Step 2: Energy Estimate. In the weak formulation , We may take the test function o : 5 to get the energy estimate Then we have On the other hand, we can Â£ uare on both sides of to obtain Multiplying a sufficiently small constant on both sides of and adding it to to absorb lealzacr4 and lla al7aaxsty we deduce
