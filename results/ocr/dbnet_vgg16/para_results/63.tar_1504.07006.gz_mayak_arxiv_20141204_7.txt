Thus the number of hits, N, is the lines leading to Eq. , we can estimate the Poisson-distributed, PN = e-NNN/NI, which means the acteristic dose rate ds by assuming the crossover to fraction of cells not hit is PN=0 = e-N. Assuming a cur at a fraction P = 0.1 of cells being hit. This yields linear dose response, N = n D, with n N 4/Gy , and ds p/nr 2 0.025Gy/a, under the same caveats as men delivery of the dose D = dr over a characteristic tioned above.

Comparison with previous studies As discussed earlier on, for mechanistic models, the risk is essentially determined by its structure, particularly, the radiation response. A dose-rate dependent pro liferation rate, 7, saturating for larger dose rates is found in many studies applying the two-stage This is on the same order of magnitude as the value model to a-particle-induced lung cancer.
