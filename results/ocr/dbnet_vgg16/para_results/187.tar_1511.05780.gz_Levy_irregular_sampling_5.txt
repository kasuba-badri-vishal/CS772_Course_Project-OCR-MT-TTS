Moreover, let SeplCp,d.p.Cyeg.0 be the class of functions 9 such that X is a compound Poisson process, CI <C, and The following result which describes the rates of convergence with respect to the prescribed smoothness classes introduced above is a direct consequence of Theorem 3.1. Proposition 3.2. Let K be the sinc-kernel. This is equzvalent to stating that SK = Let h* be implicitly defined, as the solution of the minimization equation 1-1,1. Then Let h* be the solution of Aytr-wThen Let h* be the solution of 2e,h-2a ACA. a Assume that p > 0 holds anla/2 The 6
