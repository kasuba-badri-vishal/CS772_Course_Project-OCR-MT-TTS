13 crystal without time-reversal symmetry. Once again, we ment the numerical results of the preceding section with emphasize that this effect would be absent in the linear as simplified analytical solution of Eq. . Our approach approximation of the energy spectrum around the Weyl is partly related to that of Ref. 33, which studied twoThus far, we have assumed that the direction of light at length scales that far exceed the screening length, i.e., propagation is along the positive 2 direction. If the difor momenta that are small compared to the Thomasrection of propagation is reversed, the roles of LCP and Fermi screening wave vector ks If ks is large compared RCP are exchanged32 and consequently the valley polarto the momentum cutoff of the model , but still small compared to the separation between the Weylnodes, then we IV. ANALYTICAL RESULTS The objective of this section is to support and supplecan approximate Eq. as In this approximation, only m = 0,+1 channels contribute to the effective electron-hole attraction. Out of these, only the m = +1 are active under irradiation by LCP and RCP lights. In addition, Eq. becomes independent of the interaction strength because g/K2 is independent of 9 in the Thomas-Fermi approximation. Finally, the interaction kernel is separable into "primed" and "non-primed" variables, which will enable an analytical solution of the corresponding Wannier equation. In fact, the problem at hand becomes a variation of the Cooper problem in the BCS theory of Let us consider the m = 0 channel first. Dividing both parts of Eq. by !

Applying to Eqs. and , the latter become k, we arrive at the condition J where we have taken the zero temperature limit, and EF <O . Besides, for simplicity, we have neglected the self-energy correction to the energy bands, sO that Br 1 B,. We remind strained by the condition B,l KA .
