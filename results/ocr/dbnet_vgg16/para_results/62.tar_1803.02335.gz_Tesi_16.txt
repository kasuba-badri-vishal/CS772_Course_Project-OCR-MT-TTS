Giorgio Comitini Correlation functions which include the ghost fields are generated by adding to the action analogous source terms for the ghosts. 1.1.2 Standard perturbative expansion Due to the presence of the non-linear interaction terms in S, the partition function cannot be evaluated exactly and one has to resort to perturbative methods for its computation. As long as the coupling constant 9 is assumed to be small, one can aim to The g-dependence of the partition function comes from the exponential of the interacobtain a perturbative expansion of Z in powers of g. tion terms Sint : SyM,int + SFPints By Taylor-expanding the interaction exponential eiSimt, the partition function can be rewritten as Here So = SSint, is the action for a free gauge vector field and a free ghost field. Eq. can be expressed in momentum space as 8
