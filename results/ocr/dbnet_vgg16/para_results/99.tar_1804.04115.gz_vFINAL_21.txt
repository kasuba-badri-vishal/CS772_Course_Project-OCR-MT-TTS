MCF WITH SURGERY FOR LOW ENTROPY HYPERSURPACES 22 Since by lemma 2.5 the entropy for a compact hypersurface will be attained by an F functional centered in its convex hull, without loss of generality To is in the convex hull of M#. Since for such TO we have z = zol <D<o?, we see for a lower bound C on T we have Ve EmE 5 B<o for any choice of I € Mr. Denote this We also note similarly for T > CI that the Gaussian weight of a Fro, functional is bounded below by en 4c > 0; denote this lower bound by 0. Also denote by mor and Mao,r the minimum and maximum respectively upper bound by p. -D2 of the Gaussian weight of Fpo,r in VeThen the following is true: Since a > 0 and p < 0 we can make this quotient as close to one as we like by making Te sufficiently small; in other words we can make the ratio of the minimum to the maximum of the weight in these F functionals as close to 1 as we want in Ue by increasing HneckSwitching to the translated and rescaled picture the ratio persists under rescaling, we have for To € Ui and for T > Ci the following: I 2of course, the diameter is decreasing under the flow SO is uniformly bounded by the diameter of the initial time slice
