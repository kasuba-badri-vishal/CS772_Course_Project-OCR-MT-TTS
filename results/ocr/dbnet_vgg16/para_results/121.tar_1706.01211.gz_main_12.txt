13 complexity of pile-up decomposition. SDDs can bring significant contributions at FELS in photon counting, spectrum measurements, and background measurements and set-up We present a pulse processing method based on fitting individual, overlapping pulses with pulse functions which allows extracting precise amplitude and timing information in the presence of pulse pile-up and clipping. We demonstrate that, for individual pulses, the pulse amplitude is not an optimal estimator for signal amplitude ; instead, the pulse amplitude and peaking time are obtained for each pulse by fitting. This removes the need for pulse shaping and takes into account Avoiding pulse shaping reduces peaking times to tens of nanoseconds, resulting in reduced pule pile-up and allowing GLOSSARY ADC: Analog-to-digital converter CSPAD: Cornell-SLAC pixel array detector CXI: Coherent X-ray Imaging instrument at LCLS DAC: Digital-to-analog converter ePix: SLAC hybrid pixel detector platform ePixS: Spectroscopic pixel detector in the ePix family FEL: Free-electron laser FWHM: Full width at half maximum LCLS: Linac Coherent Light Source at SLAC PDF: Probability density function r.m.s.: Root mean square SDD: Silicon drift detector SLAC: SLACI National Accelerator Laboratory XPP: X-ray Pump-Probe instrument at LCLS optimization. pulse pile-up.

Kenney. photons, photon pile-up occurs and the photon rates are not accurately described by the standard proxy, i.e., area of one can be accurately described and fitted with the photon pileup model presented here, yielding precise estimates of the photon rates in individual lines and effectively decomposing the spectrum. We also extended the model to include the stretching of the Poissonian statistics of pile-up introduced by sources with variable intensity . We present a Bayesian decomposition approach which allows accurate decomposition of individual photon energies in single pile-up events, and estimating its error rate in the order of1% for the spectrum discussed in this paper The photon pile-up and Bayesian decomposition presented pile-up decomposition , or even usual pulse processing with pile-up rejection .
