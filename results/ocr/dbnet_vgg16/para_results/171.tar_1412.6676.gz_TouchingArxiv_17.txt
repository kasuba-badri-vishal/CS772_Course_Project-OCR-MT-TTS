We claim that 9 is adjacent to p in CkIndeed, conditions C1 and C3 hold trivially. To verify C2, consider a curve e E S2 touching d at a point in the arc of d from 9 to d. This touching point lies inside Ti. However, e must intersect b, SO it must leave Ti. It touches a, SO it must leave through either bi or C Here G has fewer than 2a?k points in X, by our choice of i, while bi contains fewer than a?k points in X, since Case 2 does not hold. Hence, e has fewer than 3a?k points where it can leave Ti, and there are at most 3a?k possible choices for the curve e. This means that condition C2 is satisfied and 9 is adjacent to P in CkBy our choice of i, we can select the curve d in at least k/a different ways, each giving rise to a different edge in Ck incident to p. The total weight of these edges is a. This completes the analysis of the last case, showing that the total weight of all edges in Ak, Ak Aks Bk and Ck incident to p Summing over all 1 possible values of k and over all n2 touching points in T, we conclude that the total weight of G is at least aflogmm2. Comparing this lower bound with the upper bound proved in the preceding subsection and substituting a = logn/loglogn, Theorem 7 follows. is at least a. References , 139-186. P. K. Agarwal and M.
