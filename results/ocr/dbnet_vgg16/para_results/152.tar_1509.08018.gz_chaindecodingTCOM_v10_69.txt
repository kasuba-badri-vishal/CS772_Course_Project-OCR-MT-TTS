70 In fact, if ys,m € £1,3 for some VP 5 m A n, then the PU packet is successfully decoded in slot m; similarly, if ys,m E f5,6,7 for some Vp 5 m < n, then the PU packet becomes connected to the root of the CD graph. Specializing to this case and using , we need to prove the recursion 53 In fact, if ys,n €E f1,2, the root is successfully decoded and the full CD potential is released, resulting in The new root of the CD graph becomes ps = n+1 , with CD potential Us,, sO that Otherwise, the root of the CD graph remains unchanged, Ps = ps, with CD potential Ns,,ns and no SU packets are decoded, SO that Ms,. It follows that May 27, 2020 DRAFT
