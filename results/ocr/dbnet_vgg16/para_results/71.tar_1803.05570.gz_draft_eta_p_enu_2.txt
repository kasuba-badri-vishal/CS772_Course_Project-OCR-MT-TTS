We measure the branching fractions for D+ 1 netue to be X 10-4, and for D+ 1 n'etVe to be x 10-4, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. In addition, we, perform a measurement of the form factor in the decay D+ 1 metVe. All the results are consistent with those obtained by the CLEO-c experiment. Keywords: BESIII, charm semileptonic decay, form factor I. INTRODUCTION and Bretvs = X 10-4 , respec tively. In this paper, we present new measurements Charm semileptonic decays involve both the these BFs, using DD meson pairs produced near thresh c-quark weak decay and the strong interaction.
