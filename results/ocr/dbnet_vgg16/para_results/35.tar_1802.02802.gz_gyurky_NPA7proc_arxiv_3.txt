statistical model calculations overestimate the measured 64Zn6lCu at the lowest studied energies while the agreement becomes fairly good when the energy increases. In the case of the SMARAGD code the standard calculations are carried out with the alpha-nucleus optical potential of McFadden and Satchler . This potential was developed based on 25MeV experimental data and does not have any energy dependence. It is therefore not surprising that experimental evidence is gathering that the potential fails at low energies where an energy dependence of at least the imaginary part of the potential seems to be In order to cure the low energy problem of the McFaddenSatchler potential, an energy dependent modification was recently recommended . The depth of the imaginary part was modified using a Fermi-type function with a diffuseness parameter dE. Several recent experiments indicate that this modification leads to a better reproduction of the measured data and references therein. In the present paper this modification is tested for the 64Zn65Cu reaction. Figure 2 shows the comparison of the experimental data with SMARAGD calculation in the form ofastrophysical S-factor. The green line shows the standard calculation using the original McFadden Satchler potential. The grey band indicates the obtained S-factors by the modified potential with the dE parameter in the range between 1.5 and 5 MeV. It is evident that the modification leads to a much better reproduction of the experimental data. The best agreement is achieved with dE = 2.5MeV as indicated by the red curve. The present experimental data prove directly at astrophysical energies that the standard low energy a-nucleus optical potential must be modified. The new data support the recently suggested modification of the potential. The implementation of this modification in the reaction rate calculations for astrophysical models is recommended. The comparison of the measured and calculated 64Zn65Ga Cross section data indicate that further experimental effort is needed as only measured data can help find the correct nuclear input parameters of calculations which The authors thank T.
