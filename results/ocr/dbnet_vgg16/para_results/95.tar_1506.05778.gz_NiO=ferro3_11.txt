FIG. 3. Energy as function of T for the Monte Carlo runs. The phase transition happens at T=: 2750 t 10K. The phase at low temperatures is certainly 353, not L11, resulting from the present choice of first-principles calculation parameters. One distinguishes the two phases by the value of II corresponding to the nearest-neighbour tetrahedron of sites. The calculated transition temperature is much too high, even higher than the melting temperature. Two reasons concur to that: 1We are using an Ising Hamiltonian, noti Heisenberg For instance, 2D Ising models have ordered phases, Heisenberg models have not because the transverse spin components allow paths of relaxation. 2 We are assuming that sublattice magnetizations are unique and do not depend on spin configuration of the lattice, that is, given the concentration a the magnetization is known. Fig. 1 shows the real situation where the magnetization can fluctuate to some extent for configurations with the same I. 12
