The notation at means the inner/outer limit at the boundary of OD. More precisely, for a function w defined on Rd, one has where V is the outward normal unit vector of OD. 2 The boundary conditions over the skin are a bit more complicated . This is due to the fact that, compared to the water which has a conducFigure 2: Boundary conditions over the skin. tivity of the order of 0.01S-m-1 35, the skin is very resistive and the body is very conductive 42. In other words, one has Futhermore, the skin is very thin: if we denote its thickness by 8, we have 49 where L was defined as the body length in Section In D we have shown in the case d = 2 that, when 6/L < 1 and ks/kw < 1, but Skw is of order one , we have the following effective relation for a E as: 8R1 100um <L, 6
