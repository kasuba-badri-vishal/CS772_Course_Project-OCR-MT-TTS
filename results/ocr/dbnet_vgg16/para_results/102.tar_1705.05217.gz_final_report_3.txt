TABLE V MANTISSAS AND EXPONENT PRE/POST PROCESSING COMPLEXITY OF COMPLEX BLOCK ALU of the complex block output. With Exponent Box Encoding in the worst case, we need eight more mantissas post-scaling. Also, the Shift Vectors allow for four possible intermediate exponent values instead of one intermediate exponent value in Let X1 € CIxNi, X2 € CIxNa, and Y € CIx be complex-valued row vectors, where * denotes convolution, TABLE VI QAMTRANSMITTER, RECEIVER SPECIFICATIONS Common Exponent Encoding.

Discrete-time Complex Baseband OAM Transmitter We encode complex block IQ samples in Exponent Box Encoding and retain the floating-point resolution in 32-bit IEEE-754 precision in our model. For simplicity, we select block size to be, NJ = ITX fsym. The symbol mapper generates a ITX. faym-size of complex block IQ samples that shares common exponent. Pulse shape filter is implemented as Finite Impulse Response filter of NTX-order and requires complex convolution on the upsampled complex block in this simulation. We simulate matched V.
