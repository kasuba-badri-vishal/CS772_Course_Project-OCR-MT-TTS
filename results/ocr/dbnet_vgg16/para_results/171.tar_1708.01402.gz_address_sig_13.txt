8 Parameters of the Algorithm The use of Jaccard index to assess similarity between addresses in our algorithm is optional. Our implicit assumption is that there exists a function d which assesses the similarity between two addresses I and y. Blocking can reduce the number of evaluations of d without missing links, if d > T indicating I and 3 share a function is token. In our two-round linkage, our implicit One may design any other implicit function instead, replacing the Jaccard The Jaccard index in round 2 of the comparison can also be replaced by almost any other similarity function, for example the Monge-Elkan function , rules-based expert systems, and implementation languages that range from low-level C, to R, Python, SQL and more. In retrospect, our algorithm can be interpreted as an application of a signature-based approach to efficiently compute set-similarity joins
