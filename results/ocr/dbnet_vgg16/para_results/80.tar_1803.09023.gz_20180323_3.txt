4 KAZUHIRO ICHIHARA, MAKOTO OZAWA, AND J. HYAM RUBINSTEIN FIGURE 1. Claim 2. There are no compressing disks for Su NM+ in H. compressing disk for Su AMt in H appears for tt t. Proof. Ifsuch a compressing disk exists in Hy, then there exists a compressing disk in Si NM+ in H! for t < t by Claim 1, contradicting the assumption that the first Thus the side M must be where the first compressing disk in H, appears at the level t' . That is, Sy M has a compressing disk in Hy. Then, there are no compressing disks for Su MMt in H9, for S is strongly irreducible. Together with Claim 2, we conclude that, for t' > fand t' very close to f, there are no compressing disks for Su MM+ in M+, i.e., Su MM+ is incompressible in M+. Also, at the level t , there cannot be any compressing disks in SINMinHP Because if such a compressible disk exists, then it gives a compressing disk in SunM in H9 by Claim 1, contradicting that SHNM does not have compressing disks on both sides. Also, at the level t, there cannot be any compressing disks in SINM in H!, for the first compressing disk for Su NM in H appears for t' > f. We conclude that there cannot be any compressing disks for SINMin M at the level t, i.e., St AM is incompressible in M. This gives the second case of the Finally the third case occurs when Si NM4 has no compressing disk in H9 for t very close to t and t < t. In this case, there are no compressing disk for St AM+ in H!, for the first compressing disk for Su MMt in H appears for t > t. This implies that St NMt is incompressible in M4. In the same way, SINM has no D theorem. compressing disk in Hi. Claim 3. There are o compressing disks for St MM in HP. Proof. If such a compressing disk exists for St NM in H9, then it extends to a compressing disk in SVNM in H9 for t' > fby Claim 1. This gives a contradiction to the strong irreducibility of the splitting in the case that the first compressing disk at the level t > t appears in the M+ side . Therefore we conclude that, for t < Â£ and t arbitrarily close to E, there are no compressing disks for either St NM+ or SINM. D D
