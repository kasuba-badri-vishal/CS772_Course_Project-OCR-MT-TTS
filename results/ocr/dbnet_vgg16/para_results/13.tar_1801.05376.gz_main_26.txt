JE ext and every m, there is a word C such that al > an! and IU â‚¬ ext; since u contains the factor CU, there is an occurrence of D in u outside the prefix lnHence 2 occurs in u infinitely many times. Thus u is recurrent and we proved this implication. Now turn to the backward implication. For arbitrary words u, 3 E ext each of them occurs in u infinitely often, SO we can find a factor of the form uwA. This factor also occurs in ui infinitely often, allowing us to find arbitrarily long words I, y such that ruwy is a factor of u. Then uwN E extHence we proved the Restivo-Salemi property for Lk,aRemark 39. It is worth mentioning that for small binary languages Theorem 37 works in an extremal form. Since 2+ 5 a 5 7/3 implies ext = Fac, the language L2,a trivially has the Restivo-Salemi property; as we know from Corollary 3, all a-power-free infinite binary words contain all words of ext as factors. The following conjecture is based on extensive numerical studies. Conjecture 40. All power-free languages satisfy the Restivo-Salemi property. As an approach to Conjecture 40, we suggest the following. Open Question 41. Prove the comverse of Corollary 38. References J.-P. Allouche and J. Shallit.
