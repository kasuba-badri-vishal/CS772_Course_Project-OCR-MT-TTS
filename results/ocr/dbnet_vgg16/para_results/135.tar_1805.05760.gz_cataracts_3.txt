changed. On average, the surgery duration is 11 minutes SO that over 9 hours of video are available. A total of 21 different surgical tools are used in the videos and up to 3 tools can be visible at a time. However, this is extremely rare and most frames show no tools , one tool or two tools . The videos have been independently annotated by two experts, which allows to ignore frames where the experts disagree during the evaluation. For each frame and surgical tool, a label indicates if the tool touches the eyeball. Note that this means a tool can be visible but still not annotated because it does not yet touch the eyeball. Also, multiple tools can be present in a single frame but bounding box information to distinguish the tools in the frame is not available. This is essentially a weakly supervised classification setting or more specifically multi-label classification. Finally, all 50 videos have been evenly split into a training and test set but labels are only provided for the training set. B. Dataset challenges and preprocessing The dataset poses some challenges that have to be addressed before being usable for training. First of all, the video resolution is-very high at 1920x1080 pixels. This is a problem for CNNs as the required processing time and especially memory is directly influenced by the image resolution. However, the images cannot be scaled down arbitrarily because most tools are elongated objects of only about 30 pixels width. A resolution of 960x540 pixels was found to be a good compromise between neighboring frames during supervised learning yields almost no information gain. Therefore, only every sixth frame of each resource demands and object size. Fig. 3. Three exemplary instances of the FFE network family with different Due to the nature of video, subsequent frames are extremely choices for k and the classification head. Left: k = 49, avg-fc. Center: k = 40, similar to one another. They are heavily correlated and using positive and negative examples. The set of positive examples video is used during training which leads to 200: ms intervals for class i contains all frames that show tool i , while the set of negative examples this way, but the required training time is reduced considerably. Each of the binary problems is trained using the cross-entropy has implications on the choice of validation data. Consider avg-fc. Right: k = 40, conv-max. contains all other frames. loss function Additionally, the similarity between neighboring frames a random split of all frames into a large training and small validation set. It is highly likely that for each frame in the validation set either the predecessor or successor of that frame is part of the training set. The validation error would therefore be a significant underestimation of the test error. Instead, the where P E is the predicted probability the 25 training videos are set aside for validation purposes. for the positive class. While the binary The dataset also exhibits a strong class imbalance. Because problems are conceptually separate, this makes no difference almost half of all frames do not show any tools, this subset during training. For each example in the training set, the loss the data is undersampled to 40% of its original size. While is calculated for all C network outputs and then backpropagated the number of available training examples for each tool also through the network. A. Dataset description varies considerably, the more important consideration is how many videos contain a sequence showing each tool. This relevant because frames showing the same tool in differer videos are a lot more varied than frames showing the san IV.

In consequence, the available vide scope has been video recorded in a resolution of 1920x1080 are distributed between training and validation set SO that bo pixels at 30 frames per second. The viewpoint is mostly static contain some videos showing each tool. The distribution but the camera shakes and occasionally the zoom level is the eventual split can be seen in Figure 4.
