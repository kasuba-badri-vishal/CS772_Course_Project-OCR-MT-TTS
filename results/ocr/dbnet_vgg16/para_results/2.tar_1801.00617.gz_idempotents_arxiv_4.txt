Variety of idempotents in nonassociative algebras Ver.: Sun 31st May, 2020, 00:175 which is naturally identified with a corresponding element SA € V'OV-BV.IF e-fe1En is an arbitrary basis in A, where n = dimk A, then A induces a K-quadratic polynomial map VA K" 1 Kn defined by where € is the coordinatization map €:=e: K"A, I=EK". Int this setting, VA is a bilinear map on K". Then an element C = E € A is idempotent if and only if the corresponding I € Kn is a fixed point of A, i.e. It is convenient to consider the projectivization of the latter system. Namely, let VA = VA Toz, where X = € Kn+1. The modified equation is homogeneous of degree 2. By the made assumption on K, we can consider both and as equations over the complex numbers. Furthermore, defines a variety in CPn. Clearly, if I solves then X = is a solution of , and, conversely, X = solves with TO nan 0 then 5 is a solution of . In the exceptional case To = 0, one has = 0, i.e. E is a 2-nilpotent in A. In summary, there exists a natural bijection between the set P and all solutions of in CPn. In this picture, 2nilpotents correspond to the finfinite! part of solutions of Then the classical Bezout's theorem implies the following dichotomy: either there are infinitely many solutions of or the number of distinct solutions is less or equal to 2", where n = dimk A. Therefore if the set P is finite then with O = 0. necessarily We point out that one should interpret a solution to in the projective sense.
