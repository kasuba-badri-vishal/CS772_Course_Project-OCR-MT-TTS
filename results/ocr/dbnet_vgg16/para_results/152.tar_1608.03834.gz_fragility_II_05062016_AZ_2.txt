3 a Yukawa-potential type expression. The Born-Mayer known fact, it turns out that B is the most sensitive pacontribution is a simple xponentialy-dcaymg function rameter in our analysis, in the sense that small variations of the core-core separation, motivated by the radial dein B can lead to large deviations in the fitting of the excay of electron wavefunctions for the closed shells. The perimental data. Conversely, the Ashcroft prefactor A is effective interatomic potential reads as not a sensitive parameter, and its values are not crucial In Ref. , it was found that, in order to fit shear modulus and viscosity data of various alloys, values of the Born-Mayer repulsion strength B are required which are between two and three orders of magnitude smaller than the Born-Mayer parameters tabulated for pure metals. This important difference has at least two reasons. One reason is that the Born-Mayer formula used for pure substances in the literature is written 2 expl-Cr, instead of 2 expl-Cl, which we use here. Evidiscrepancy. However, the fact that B fitted for multifor the match with experiments. where ist the Ashcroft factor , with Rcore being a typical dently, exp refer to pairs of atoms, Fermi theory, and its value is known for different types in which the outer electronic structure. is clearly much of alloys . We choose a representative value for QTF different from metals, where the atoms are significantly The ionic core diameter a is obtained by a weighted avIII. THE GLOBAL INTERATOMIC REPULSION in the alloys are taken from Ref. . sons related to the change in electronic structure, the as 1.7 A-1 according to the values reported in Ref. . ionized. erage of the core diameters of the atoms constituting the alloys taken from , where the weights correspond to The characteristic range 1/C of the valence-shlloverPARAMETER A 8, the ratios of the respective atoms. In the analysis of Ref. it was found that different lap repulsion is not known a priori. However, its typdisordered alloys can be described by an effective interical values are less sensitive to the atomic composition atomic potential given by Eq. with A = 0.3 0.5eV, than the parameters a, A and B. Different atoms have and B = 5 60 eV. The value of a is uniquely detervery similar values typically in the range C = 1.89 mined by the elemental composition of the alloy, whereas The latter cannot be easily estimated from firstcomposition. Furthermore, an even simpler parametrizaofthe Born-Mayer term, can be rigorously evaluated only ping Eq. onto a logarithmic expression with a single, from the exchange integrals of the various overlapping global parameter A, which contains all the information electrons belonging to the valence shells of the two interabout the steepness of the acting ions. This calculation, even in approximate form, ion-ion repulsion. This simpler expression reads as 4.72 A-1 . principles or from QTF = 1.7 A-1 can be kept constant, independent of tion of the interatomic potential was obtained literature. Similarly, the prefactor B by mapis not feasible except for simple monoatomic crystals. Hence, both A and B were taken in our previous analysis as adjustable parameters in the mapping between our schematic logarithmic potential and the Asherol-Borre-Mayer interatomic poab initio simulation studies . Consistent with this The mapping between Eq. and Eq. is shown The main advantage of representing the repulsive par tential. We shall remark that the Born-Mayer prefactor Fig.1, for representative parameters of metallic glasses B typically has non-trivial large variations from element In all instances examined thus far, Eq. is very accu to element across the periodic table, as shown in many rately represented by Eq..
