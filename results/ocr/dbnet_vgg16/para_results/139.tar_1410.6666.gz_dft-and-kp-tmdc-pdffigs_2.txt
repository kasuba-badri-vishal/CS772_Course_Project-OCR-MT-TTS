k-p theory for 2D TMDCS 3 to the tight-binding description of TMDCS 2632 33 34 35 36 37 38, but this approach suffers from the large number of atomic orbitals that have to be included on each site and the need for epond.ieatet-egiion hopping to account for the variation of the weight of individual atomic orbitals in the band wave functions across the BZ, as revealed by detailed density functional theory modelling using the symmetry properties of TMDC atomic crystals, with specific material parameters obtained by fitting them to the DFT band structures of MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2 and WTe2. nan The DFT calculations discussed in this Review were Most of the recent theoretical and experimental work has focused on the properties of Mos2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2, while MoTe2 and WTe2 have received much less attention. Bulk MoTe2 with a trigonal prismatic coordination of the chalcogen atoms exists below 815°C , whereas above 900°C the crystal structure is monoclinic and the material becomes metallic 61 62. Monolayer samples using liquid exfoliation technique have been obtained from a-MoTe2 63, and the optical properties of monolayer 192 the transport properties of few-layer aMoTez 64 191 have been investigated recently, giving a clear motivation to include this material in our review. Bulk WTe2 has an orthorhombic crystal structure, where eight tellurium atoms surround the tungsten atom in a distorted octahedral coordination 65 66. Nevertheless, one would expect that it may be possible to grow monolayer WTe2 with hexagonal prismatic coordination on a suitable substrate. For completeness, therefore, we include this material as well, assuming that its hexagonal number of parameters while still offering an accurate description.
