where 2, p and C are the background flow velocity, density and speed of sound, and t and are the standard time and gradient operator of Newtonian mechanics. Conservation of mass for the background flow tells us that, Using this along Eq. a altered expression for 0, where V acts on everything to its right. This may seem like a needless complication : but as pointed out by, for example, Visser , we can write this as the d'Alembertian of a curved, 4-dimensional space-time of mixed signature, g!" is the inverse of the metric guv of the space, and 9 is the determinant of gu. Hence it becomes clear that we can regard d as a scalar field on a 4-dimensional space with the metric guv defined by the background flow. This space is the acoustic space-time. The authors who have pointed this out have largely used it as a tool to illuminate what parts of general relativity are due to Einstein's field equations specifically, and what phenomena remain when the equations are changed but the form of the geometry remains . We, however, would like to turn this on its head, making use of the acoustic space-time to illuminate how variable transtormations can be used to understand sound propagation in the The idea of these transformations is to use a change of variables to convert a challenging equation, such as Eq. , into, say, the classic wave equation. To the authors knowledge the most general transformation to date of this kind was first presented by Taylor , and is valid for irrotational, barotropic, low Mach number, steady background flows for acoustic fields where the wavelength is of the same order of magnitude or smaller than the length scale of variations of the background flow ; ultimately this a preference of the authors. We find that the approach gives more streamlined and intuitive proofs of some key results, and also allows more to be expressed independently of coordinates. A debate of the relative benefits is beyond the scope of the current paper. As was general manifolds. More precisely we shall introduce Geometric Algebra . 2
