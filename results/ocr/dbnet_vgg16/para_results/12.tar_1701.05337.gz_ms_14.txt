Precision cosmology with baryons: non-radiative hydrodynamics of galary groups 15 outer regions, as we observe in our non-radiative simulations and in Sembolini et al. for grid-based codes. SPH codes with an entropy profile decreasing all the way to 7 CORRELATIONS BETWEEN HALOS STRUCTURAL PARAMETERS In the previous section, we have compared our sample of 16 halos to an hydrostatic analytical profile. For a given halo mass, usually defined by M200, one needs to introduce an important structural parameter, namely the concentration parameter C. The statistic of this parameters has been well studied using N body simulations , Once M200 and C have been chosen, we can deduce the corresponding values for Ts and Ps, and the hydrostatic equations give us immediately To and Po . In order to improve the quality of the fit for a given halo, we now introduce 2 new structural parameters Pgas and each individual halo profile was offset with respect to the analytical prediction Po and To by a fixed amount. We interpreted this constant ofset in the centre as different entropy levels reached at halo formation time. We now consider these random variables, and will study now their correlation propIn the previous section, we have used the turbulent energy to correct the analytical gas temperature, in order to account for non-thermal pressure support, and we have identified a correlation between the amount of turbulent energy in each halo and its formation epoch. The level of turbulence in the halo is therefore another new and important the centre. 6.9 Summary We have quantified the dispersion of our profiles with respect to the average profile by measuring the variance with typical values of 10-20% of the numerical mean. In extreme cases, it can reach up to 35-50%. Individual halos profiles deviate up to 20-40% from the mean, and are mostly in the peaks and throughs in the outer regions. We have also estimated how well the numerical results reproduce the analytical profiles predicted by the model introduced in Section We find an overall good agreement for all quantities. In the case of the gas temperature, however, pressure support. a significant contribution of the turbulence, especially in the outer regions. We have fitted the turbulent specific energy with a simple linear function of the radius, and subtracted it from the analytical temperature profile. from the numerical mean remain smaller than 20%. Wel have confirmed the results of Ascasibar et al. , namely that analytical hydrostatic and polytropic gas profiles resulting from an NFW total mass distribution are good estimates for the actual numerical profiles. Note that we have observed a very good agreement between the total mass profile fitted the NFW model to the dark matter mass distribution, ignoring the baryons. This could partly explain why, in their case, they seem to find an excellent agreement between the numerical temperature profile and the uncorrected analytical model, without the need for invoking turbulence. We have checked this issue by extracting the NFW parameters Ts and Ps from the previous work by Ascasibar et al. . Our assumption was partly confirmed, since we found a better agreement between the uncorrected analytical and numerical curves in the intermediate range 0.5Ts <TK 5Ts. Above and below this interval however, the differences between the two curves became even larger. The other possibility is that their SPH simulations are underestimating by a factor of 2 the level of residual turbulent energy. Note that our mass resolution is higher by a factor of 20 than was achievable more than 10 years ago. The size of their sample is similar toours, with 15 halos, but they are distributed over a wider mass range and contain also galaxy cluster sized objects. We also noticed that Ascasibar et al. measured underestimation of the turbulence, could explain this discrepancy. Our results agree also very well with the Figure 1 of Nagai et al. obtained with a sample of 16 galaxy clusters simulated with the Eulerian code ART. For the gas density and temperature profiles, we have reproduced the behaviour at small radii reported in Sembolini et al. , of constant entropy in the centre, in contrast to this classical form of constant offsets in the centre, and in the form of and can be considered as an independent random variable. our numerical results significantly underestimated the anaTgasy which denotes the central gas density and the central lytical prediction. We argued that we have to include to the gas temperature. We have seen in Section and Section that After this correction, the deviations of the analytical model 2new parameters Pgas and Tgas as two possible independent erties. the the NFW combined and model. We would like to point out, structural parameter. We it as where Tmax = 10.8Ts is used as upper bound of the integral because 10.8 is the average C value. For comparison, value of each individual halo as upper limit. This had only an insignificant influence on the result. We now show the correlation of the various pairs of the following 5 possibly independent random variables in Figure 11. To quantify the Correlations between two random variables, we. calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient C and show it in the correThe correlation between C and Zform is very high, with Pearson coefficient of 0.85. This well know properties reveals that concentrated halos have formed at an earlier epoch. As we have already anticipated, we also have strong anti-correlations between Tturb tween Tturb and 2form with a correlation coefficient of -0.6 For the particular cases of halos 2, 7,9 and 12 , one can see that they form a subset halos that formed particularly early, with a rather high COI centration and a rather low level of turbulence. The opposit is true for halo 8, which formed late, has a low concentration While there is no correlation between the central gas pa circular velocity plot of the dark matter mass only, as in the we have also calculated the integral by using the T200 = C-Ts sponding panel. a smaller variance for the profiles than we did.
