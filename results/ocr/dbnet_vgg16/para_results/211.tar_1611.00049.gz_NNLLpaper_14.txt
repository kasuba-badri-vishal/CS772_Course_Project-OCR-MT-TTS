Figure 2. Comparison between different perturbative approximations to the total CrossS section carried out with the default factorization scale choices Hf,0 = M/2 and Hf,0 = M . The labels "NLL" and "NNLL" on the horizontal axis indicate NLO-+NLL and combine the envelope of results from the two choices into a single, larger perturbative uncertainty. The NLO+NNLL results quoted at either scale would not change NLO+NNLL calculations. significantly through such a combination. 3.3 Differential distributions In this section we discuss results for differential distributions. In particular, we the distribution differential with respect to the invariant mass of the top pair and the distribution differential with respect to the invariant mass of the top-quark the distribution differential with respect to the transverse momentum of the Higgs the distribution differential with respect to the transverse momentum of the top We first set the default value of the factorization scale to Hf,o = M/2. Figure 3 shows the comparison between complete NLO calculations and approximate NLO calculations for all of the distributions listed above. We observe that for all of the distributions the approximate NLO scale uncertainty band is included in the NLO consider: Higgs boson in the final state, M; pair, Mii boson, PF: quark, Pr 14 nan
