11 where again we have dropped the subscript of N on ahj to indicate we have taken the limit ofN 00, and we define Z Then we take the large i limit of xih,3i+5h-K. Redefining @ = qyPu-6, removing -1, and using , we obtain where we define 22226u =y*0ww-1 E,l' Finally we rewrite by defining a = uy-2 to get where we define Z, 40
