4 where II = -Pl+n in terms of half the length of the swimmer, L. We consider swimmers with concentration gradients generated by the colloids on a scale c*/a. Hence we express the flux J of reactant particles in units of c*D/a, the concentration field C in units of c*, , the interaction energy 1 in the units of thermal energy kBT, , the flow field D with U* = p'c*/a molecules with the swimmer surface. We scale the pressure field p with nU*/L. We note that the problem has three length-scales; the swimmer characteristic length 21, its cross-sectional radius a and the range L* of the interaction between the molecules and swimmer surface. Consequently, we have three asymptotic near-field We therefore define the dimensionless parameters, E = a/l, the slenderness ratio and A = L*/1, the interaction layer thickness to the swimmer largest lengthscale, with 0 <A<E<1 In addition, we define dimensionless fields J=. Ja/c*D, C = C/c*, =0/U*, p= pI/nU*, 3b = kBT, and the dimensionless catalytic flux a = aa/c*D on regions and in addition the scale on which the ends of the rod are rounded. the swimmer surface. where A = L*/lis the ratio of the interaction length-scale to half the length of the swimmer, E = a/l is the swimme slenderness ratio and a, is the short-range interaction potential between reactant molecule and surface. and the concentration decays to its value far from the swimmer, C 1 Coo, V2+22-00. The zero torque and force conditions are where II = -pl + is the dimensionless stress tensor and ds, dV are the surface and volume elemen in cylindrical coordinates respectively. C.
