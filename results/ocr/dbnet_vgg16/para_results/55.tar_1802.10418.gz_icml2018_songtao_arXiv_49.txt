where p is the upper bound of term 1 + IA T'-1 and can be obtained by Quantifying the Norm of v Projected at Different Subspaces: Then, we will use mathematical induction to prove Iti is true when t = 0 since 1! 115 0. Assuming that equation is true at the tth iteration, we. need to prove Applying into RHS of , we. have V and substituting into LHS of we have V Then, our goal is to prove RHS of is ater than RHS f . After some manipulations, it is sufficient to show V In the following, we will show that the above relation is true. First step : We know that where is true because we choose Gnax 1 and 7 5 Cmax/LmaxSecond step : Also, we know lat With the above two steps, we have A 5 4ut+ 16, which completes the induction. 50
