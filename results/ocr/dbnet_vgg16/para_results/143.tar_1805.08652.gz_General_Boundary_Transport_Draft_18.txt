BOUNDARY LAYER OF TRANSPORT EQUATION 19 I Us ng the trace theorem, we lave 3.19 Also, we obtain nan J Collecting terms in , , , and , we obtain Then this naturally implies t at Step 2: Energy Estimate. In the weak formulation , WE may take the test function nan t to get the energy estimate Jf Then we have I On the other hand, we can S uare on both sides of to obtain Multiplying a sufficiently small constant on both sides of and adding it to to absorb llullzer and llu alb2Axsly, we deduce Jf
