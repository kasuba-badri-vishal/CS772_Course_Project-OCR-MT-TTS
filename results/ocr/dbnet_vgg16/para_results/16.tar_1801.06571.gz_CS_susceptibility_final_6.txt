7 Sectors with M = 2,M = 3 are the subsets of diagrams with 2,3,... cross-sections in which we split the poles of the Green's functions with equal frequencies and momenta separated by q. In the cross-sections in between the selected ones GG is again approximated by G. The contribution from the M = 2 sector is represented by the skeleton diagram in Fig. 5 labeled M = 2. It contains fully dressed side vertices AFta and a fully dressed anti-symmetrized static interaction between fermions on the FS. One can easily FIG. 5. The ladder series of diagrams for the static susverify that this interaction appears with the prefactor ceptibility xst The exact XL is represented as a series Z2, i.e., the extra factor in the M = 2 sector M = 0,1,2,ofbubbles comprised of Green' 's functions with compared to M = 1 is the product of X1,0 and the correpoles on opposite halves of the complex frequency plane, i.e. sponding component of the Landau function. Using . bubbles. A simple bookkeeping analysis shows that con Fermions at such high energies have a finite damping, i.e., tributions from sectors with larger M form a geometri are not fully coherent quasiparticles. By this reason, the series, which transform 1 Frde into 1/. Col M = 0 contribution to xte is labeled as an incoherent lecting all contributions, we reproduce Eq. . We next move to the M = 1 sector. Here we select the 3. The susceptibility xt at finite S/uFlg. We now extend the analysis to the case when both subset of diagrams with one cross-section, in which we transferred momentum q and transferred frequency 2 are pick up the contribution from GKpGk+q.A from vanishingly small, but the ratio S/vplg! is finite. The the range where the poles in the two Green's functions computational steps are the same as for static suscepthe skeleton diagram in Fig. 5labeled M = 1. The sector and the vertex function Agls do not depend on internal part of this diagram gives Z-m*/mxao, the ratio of 2 and remain the same as in the where X1,o is given by . The side vertices contain static case. However, the integrand in the expression for Agtrtkp, i.e. the product of the bare form-factor pendence via UFlql COS Pk/. This , and the makes the computation of series with M = 1,2, more are in different half-planes of complex frequency. The tibility. The contribution to from the M = sum of such diagrams can be graphically represented X by X,0, Eq. , now contains a non-trivial angular decontributions from all other cross-sections, in which involved. GG is approximated by G-. These contributions would vanish if we used a static once we include dynamical screening at order U2 and higher. Similarly to the M = 0 sector, the difference Agta 1is determined by fermions with energies of Order Ep. Note, however, that in the M = 0 sector, all internal energies are of order Ep. In the M = 1 sector, internal energies for the vertices Arte are of order EF, but external Wk are infinitesimally small, and external k are on the FS. Overall, the contribution to the static susceptibility from the M = 1 soctor is Consider first the limiti 2 < vrlgl. For even 1, the U for the interaction, but again become non-zero free-fermion susceptibility is where a1 = 1ifl= 0 and a1 = 2 if = 2m, m > For odd 1, the expansion in 2 starts with 22. The tot contribution from the M = 1 sector still is proportiona to X,0:
