were and The second-order approximation contains a biharmonic operator. We can approximately replace it with a reaction-diffusion system for solutions which are approximately oscillatory in space with one dominant wavenumber k, SO that Vus-KVu. Then we have where Duu & Duu k?Quu. If the solutions of interest, or their Laplacians, are not approximate solutions of the Helmholtz equation, this second-order approximation is clearly only a euristic. The direct transtormation from system to system or , and its inverse, can be used for searching for nontrivial regimes in the full system, based on the existing experience of nontrivial regimes 1.Do parametric search in the reduced system, which has fewer parameters and often is easier to 2. Once an interesting regime is found, estimate the dominant wavenumber k for it, say as the maximum 3. Use the inverse transformation to obtain parameters for the full system corresponding to the found in the analogues of the reduced systems: compute, as it is less stiff; oft the power spectrum of the spatial profile; parameters of the reduced system; 4. See what solutions the full system with these parameters will produce. 3 Results 3.1 Direct transform components in a linear way: As a simple example, we now consider a three-component extension of a two-component system with nonlinear kinetics, where a third component is added, which has fast linear kinetics and linked to the other 4
