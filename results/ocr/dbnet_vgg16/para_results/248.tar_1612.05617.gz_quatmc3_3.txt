4 To overcome this problem we follow the iterative method employed in Refs. 45-48 which is based on the Binder cumulant. As the renormalization group calculations predict infnite-randomness criticality with activated dynamical scaling, the scaling form of the Binder cumulant reads Here T = Tc denotes the distance from criticality, Xg is a scaling function, and 3b and V refer to the tunneling and correlation length critical exponents. LP FIG. 1.

At criticality Le must thus behave as In 2 L, fixing the second argument of the scaling function Xg: are found, finite-size scaling proceeds as usual. 49,50 To test our simulation and data analysis technique, we first consider the case E = 0 for which the quantum Ashkin-Teller model reduces to three decoupled random transverse-field Ising chains whose quantum phase transition is well understood.4 We perform simulations for sizes L = 10 to 50 and LE = 2 to 20000 and find a critical the activated scaling ofthe Binder cumulant with the After this successful test, we now turn to the AshkinConsequently, the peak value is independent of L where denotes we also measure the SAMAK the thermodynamic at criticality, and the 9av VS.
