Thus, if the latter is multiplied by 100, sO will be the maximum energy too. field around SNRs is indeed what has been suggested resonant streaming instability as well as non-resonant, , and on observational grounds, with the interpretation of the extreme thinSNRS as due to the synchrotron losses of the highestenergy electrons in the local, intense magnetic fields However, even with such a large field amplification, by a factor of order 100, and even if one assumes that this can be maintained at the appropriate length scale tob be fully profitable to particle acceleration, it remains very difficult for DSA to accelerate protons up to 1 PeV be very far from what is needed to validate, at least in principle, the SNR-GCR connection. Indeed, the above study of the GCR/EGCR transition, in the light of the experimental data on the highest energy cosmic-rays, shows that the GCR sources must be able to accelerate protons at least up to a 1017 eV . This is two orders of magnitude higher than what can be optimistically achievedby standard SNRs . 4.2. The "other source ' solution One solution to save the SNR-GCR connection is to invoke an additional source of GCRs. Basically, the SNRS would account for the GCR spectrum up to the knee, while another type of sources would account for the spectrum above that. This other component could be either Galactic, or extragalactic . This does not seem very likely, however, because the matching of the two independent components in a seamless knee-like structure is particularly difficult may also refer to Ockham's razor and note that, if another type of sources, still to be identified, is needed to explain the cosmic-ray flux up to the ankle, then there main contributors to the GCRs, as these new sources might just as well dominate at lower energy too, instead of suddenly starting above the PeV energy range. This would solve the problem of matching two components Another interesting solution to save the SNR-GCR rather than a new type of sources, to fill the gap belution because there could then be no need to match two independent components in a seamless way. If smaller and smaller subset manages to accelerate particles up to higher and higher energies the Galaxy. For instance, the flux of GCRs above the knee gamma-ray bursts, or to SNRs which interact with the wind of the progenitor star during the first few years after the explosion . Of course, it remains to be confirmed that this "subset solution" is viable in practice, ie. that some SNRS can indeed accelerate particles up to Z X 1017 eV. Such a demonstration would be a remarkable achievement, and it certainly is an important astrophysical question. According to , in the case of SN 1993J, the proton maximum energy could have been as 3 1016 eV, one or two days after the outburst. Although this is still short of whatis needed, and although, according to , it does not take into account some nonlinear effects pointed out by which could reduce further the maximum energy, it suggests that the maximum GCR energies could be reached in a few exceptional sources, in some particular circumstances, SO that the usual limitations pertaining to the most studied SNRs may not be However, while this remains an open question, we wish to point out that the subset of sources needed to account for the whole GCR spectrum should not be a Let us adopt the point of view that all SNRs accelerate protons with a power-law in E-x up to the knee, at Eknee = 3x1015 eV, or above, while only a smaller fracpower-law up to an energy E > Eknee or above. What is then the fraction of the SNRS, a, which must accelerate protons up to 1017 eV or above? through a knee. Such a large amplification of the ambient magnetic 4.3.

Now, even if it were possible, this would still could be due some exceptional SN explosions or failed as 2high much lower than 1 PeV, e.g. , even though this may directly relevant. to achieve in practice . small subset, as discussed below.
