DELAYED ACCEPTANCE MCMC BY DATA SUBSAMPLING 12 Sherlock et al. study the statistical efficiency for delayed acceptance random walk Metropolis and, moreover, an efficiency that also takes into account the computational efficiency for the case where the target is estimated note that, because the transition kernels of both the MH and delayed acceptance MH are derived from the same proposal 91, and in addition a2 S 1, the delayed acceptance MH will be less statistically efficient than MH. The intuition is that under these conditions the chain clearly exhibits a more "sticky" behavior and an estimate based on these samples will have a larger asymptotic variance under DA-MH than MH. Notice that the closer a2 is to 1, the more statistically efficient the delayed acceptance algorithm is, and when a2 = 1i it is equivalent to the standard MH which gives the upper bound of the in Section 4. possible statistical efficiency achieved by a DA-MH. Result 1i in Payne and Mallick gives the alternative formulation Let L =L-l and denote by Em the estimate of = 2K-1 L. Similarly to , where qk = qk qk and the Si's are iid with 1 PrG=nD:t0. = n with DK = gk for i = 1,...m. We can also show that
