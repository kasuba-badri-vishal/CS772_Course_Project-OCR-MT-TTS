6 V= Vo+ Vsoc, Vo a Vo being the scalar potential and Vsoc = Vi + VR the SOC part of the potential. In the limit where Vo f Vsoc, the solution to Eq. can be written as: where the last expression applies to the large Vo limit Thus, to leading order, the cross section Pir is deter mined by the first term of the right hand-side, wherea 9 is determined by the the second term. Hence, 7 is ex pected to decrease at large Vo a Vo; as shown in Fig. 1 For a given set of Vo, AI, and ASR, Fig. 2 shows the behaviour of 7 and 2tr as a function of the incident electron energy E at different values of anisotropy parameter B. For the values of B close to those corresponding to the non-standard Rashba SOC , the energy dependence is strongly modified. On the other hand, for the case of a delta function potential, the anisotropy has a less pronounced effect on the cross section Zir Theobservations made above remain largely unchanged count, see. Fig 3. As shown there, thermal fluctuations smooth out the sharper features of the energy dependence EF of 7 found at T = 0 and suppress the FIG. 3. - Temperature dependence of 7 versus EF plot dependence ofy versus EF plot at AI = 15meV and four difat AI = OmeV and four different B. - Temperature when the effect of finite temperature is taken into acferent in all the eight plots.

The plots on the On the other hand, having T <B < 0: requires a strong left panel also illustrate that, B = 0 In Fig. 1, we show the dependence of the spin Hall . This angle 7 and the transport Cross section Eir at zero temis because the quantization axis for the spin current is perature on the carrier energy E for different values of aligned along the 2 axis, whereas for B = 0, Sy commutes strength of the scalar potential Vo = Ao/R2 with the Hamiltonian. As pointed out above for T = 0, for a rather anisotropic Rashba-like SOC corresponding the energy dependence , to B = -T/8. It can be seen that the enhancement of is most strongly affected as B approaches -E . However, the effect of the anisotropy is of E for which Er exhibits a peak, that is, a scatless pronounced for B > 0. This conclusion still holds tering resonance. This is in agreement with what was true when the scatterer also induces intrinsic SOC on already pointed out in Ref. 10 for the isotropic Rashba the graphene layer , as it is shown in the near the scatterer and therefore it can also experience tion of a very different energy dependence as B is the effect of the locally induced SOC. The enhancement independent of the assumption of a Dirac delta potential. ofy is suppressed at large values of VoTo understand This is investigated in detail in Appendix where circuthis effect qualitatively, let us recall that 7 and Eir are lar scatterer is assumed and the both determined by the T-matrix, which obeys the LS scattering properties in the the case of standard and nonbreaking of the C6u symmetry. the spin current as well as the spin Hall angle vanish SOC. Physically, this is also expected, because at resoright panel of Fig. 3. nance the scattering electron or hole spends most time Finally, it is also worth mentioning that the observaequation: standard Rashba are obtained. The results for the energy dependence of 7 and Eir are displayed in Fig. 4. The more complicated internal structure of the finite-radiu circular scatter, whose wave functions are distorted different ways by the standard and non-standard Rashb SOC, shows up in a very different resonant peak struc where GR is the retarded Green's function and ture exhibited by the transport Cross section Bir and the
