As in Ref. , let us consider the five-point correlation function with one degenerate field Due to the presence of the degenerate field, this correlation function satisfies a partial differenti equation, second order in 2, first order in I. For the purposes of this section it is convenient to defin the function as 3 . where the variable 2 is related with the rariablec 2 and I as K is the elliptic integral of the first ki d and O1 is the Jacobi theta function . The function defined Eq. satisfies non-stationary Schrodinger equation wit doubly periodic potential where the potential V is given by 2 and the parameters Sk are related to the parame ers ak 3 - In Eq. s is the Weierstrab elliptic function with periods T and TT defined by the infinit sum 3
