In and we replaced T with Th by using to simplify the expression. Thus, the diffusivities are and the butterfly velocities are Finally, by noticing that TL = 1 we have Notice that the &x and Ey depend only on 2 and S irrespective of 0 and S. They are also independent of charge density p and momentum relaxations ki and k2. This universality is nontrivial because the thermal conductivities, specific heat and butterfly velocity, all of them depend on through . When it comes to the combinations To investigate ifthere is any lower or upper bound of & and Eys we need to understand the parameter region of 2 and S. We will restrict ourselves to positive Ri. Based on the &x and Eys all Lr, L1, L2 and Th are canceled out. allowed parameter region obtained in section we find Class I and II where S = Aa Class I-i 29
