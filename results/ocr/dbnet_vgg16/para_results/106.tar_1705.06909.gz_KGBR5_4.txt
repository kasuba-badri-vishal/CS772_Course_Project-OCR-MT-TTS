this paper. The literature on KAM theory is enormous and SO there are many potential applications; we will only describe here some of those that may have some interest. First, and more importantly, the technical estimates we derive in Appendix for Gevrey functions actually hold true for a larger class of ultra-differentiable functions that includes Gevrey functions as a particular case. This not only leads to a further extension of the KAM theorems we state and prove here, but also allows us to generalize other perturbative results such as the Nekhoroshev theorem . To keep this paper to a reasonable length, Then, our main result Theorem Adeals with the persistence of Lagrangian tori; KAM theory also deals with lower-dimensional tori , and one may expect that our result extend to such a setting. Finally, one may consider the problem of reducibility of quasi-periodic cocycles close to constant. In the analytic case, the Bruno-Rissmann condition is sufficient, as was shown in CM12; in the a-Gevrey case, the a-Bruno-Rissmann condition is sufficient. In fact, this setting is simpler from a technical point of view and our Gevrey estimates are not necessary to obtain such a result; one simply needs to go through the proof of CM12. A possible explanation for this is that for quasi-periodic cocycles, composition occur in a linear Lie group, thus only estimates for linear composition are necessary and SO everything boils down to good estimates for the product of two functions. all these results will be derived in a subsequent article BF17 1.5 Plan of the paper The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 1 we describe precisely the setting, namely we properly define the Gevrey norms we will use and the a-Bruno-Rissmann condition. In Section we state our main Theorem Aabout the persistence of a torus in a non-degenerate Hamiltonian system results: under the -Bruno-Rissmann condition; Theorem B the iso-energetic version of Theorem A Theorem C the non-autonomous time-periodic version; condition weaker that the a-Bruno-Kussmann condition; Theorem D about the destruction of a torus in the same context not assuming a Theorem Eabout linearization of vector fields on the torus close to constant ; Theorem E the discrete version of Theorem A about the persistence of a torus in a Theorem G the discrete version of Theorem E about the linearization of diffeomornon-degenerate exact-symplectic map; phisms of the torus close to a translation. 5
