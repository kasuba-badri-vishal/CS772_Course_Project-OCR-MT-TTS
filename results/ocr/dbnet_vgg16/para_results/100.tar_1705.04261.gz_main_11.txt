Distribution of the normalized magnetic-field amplitude Bz/Bo , normalized ion number density N:/Nio and the mean kinetic energy of ions and electrons , all taken at time tymax = 15 in a small region harboring strong turbulence. Linear scales are used in all maps. Overlaid on the maps in panels , and are in-plane magnetic-field lines and likewise in-plane electric-field lines in panel . The white crosses are intended to facilitate cross-correlation of various details. One example of an ion trajectory is shown as white solid line for times tymax < 15 and as dashed line for later times. Figure 14. Distribution of the charge density in the plasma and the resulting electrostatic field . MNRAS 000, 1-16 201
