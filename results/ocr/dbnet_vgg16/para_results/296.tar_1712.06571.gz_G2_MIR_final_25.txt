4.1 T4 mirror maps from coassociative fibrations Let us begin by analyzing the generalized T4 mirror symmetry map in the context of TCS G2 manifolds. As the Kovalev CYs X admit mirrors by assumption, by the SYZ argument, these have two T3 special lagrangian fibrations. Let us denote such fibrations by LL In the asymptotically cylindrical region of the manifold X 2 R+ x S1 X St, the SYZ special lagrangians must asymptote to Lt 2 S1 X At, where At are the SYZ special lagrangian T2 fibrations within the asymptotic K3s . In particular, they do not extend along the R+ direction. Let us fix the phase of the holomorphic top form on Xt such that the SYZ special lagrangians are calibrated as follows Notice that a special lagrangian L gives rise to a coassociative cycle ML = SIxLC Slxx if and only if it satisfies . In particular, therefore, for our special lagrangians LE we have Now, Equation entails that the four-cyc 2S A t = x LI CJ are such that L which entails these are coassociative submanifolds. Since the TCS glueing diffeomorphism E is such that MI are glued into a coassociative submanifold M C J which has the topology of a T4, which may become singular along loci in Performing three T-dualities along the Lt SYZ fibres is mapping Xt to their mirrors Xy by construction. However, as the S1 within the asymptotic CY cylinders are swapped with J. 25
