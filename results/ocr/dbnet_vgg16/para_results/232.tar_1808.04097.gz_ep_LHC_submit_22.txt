at the LO QCD corrections can be found from Eq. . Since Q1,2 mix with the QCD and EW penguin operators, i.e. Q3-10, we basically need the 10 X 10 ADM matrix for the operators Qi 10Since the mixture of Q1,2 and Q3 10 is dominated by the QCD penguin operators, we adopt the f6 ADM for the new physics effects, and the APM is given as : I with f being the number of flavors. If we take the operators Q1-6 as a basis, from Eq. , the corresponding Wilson coefficients can form a vector and be expressed as CT = 8 at the MH3 scale. Using RG evolution with ADM in Eq. , the Wilson coefficients at the mc scale can be obtained as: where we have ignored the effects that are less than or around 0.1, and Cr can be Similarly, we can apply the same approach to the QSLI,N operators. From the Hamiltonian in Eq. , the Wilson coefficients at the P = mH3 scale can be formed as CSLLu = SLR and CISLLu = , the obtained from Cr using GER instead of SH. Wilson coefficients at N = mc can then be obtained as: We can obtain CYSLL from CSLL, using GRL instead of SLR Following Eqs. and and using the introduced matrix elements, the Re from the tree-level diquark contributions can be formulated as: 23
