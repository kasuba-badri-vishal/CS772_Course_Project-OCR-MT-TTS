Reid and Kontar: Beam-induced Electric Field Distributions . The density model is very similar to other constant mean background electron density means that we know solar wind density models like the Sitler-Guhathkurta model any changes on the distribution of the electric fields are caused and the Leblanc model except that the density is higher close to the Sun, ground plasma temperature was set to 10 K, indicative of the SObelow IORo: The density model reaches 5x109 cm 3 at the low lar wind core temperature at 1 AU, corona and is more indicative to the flaring Sun, compared to giving a thermal velocity of VkTe/me = 1.2x 108 cm S 1 The 109 cm-3 in the Newkirk model or 108 cm-3 in electron beam is injected into a simulation box that is just over 8 For modelling the density fluctuations we first note that the 1 AU. To fully resolve the density fluctuations we used a spatial spectral index of -5/3 . Following the same approach of Reid & Kontar the detection of Langmuir waves . The spec, we model the spectrum of density fluctuations with a tral index is obtained from the typical observed in-situ electron spectral index -5/3 between the wavelengths of 108 cm and spectra below 10 keV near the Earth . We the Leblanc model. solar radii in length, representing a finite region in space around The beam parameters are given in Table. The high characteristic time broadens the electron beam, a process that would have happened to a greater extent if our electron beam had travelled to 1 AU from the Sun. The high density ratio is to ensure a high energy density The fluctuating component of the background plasma, de10-15,10-3,10-25, 10-3, 10-35,10-4, 10-45, 10-5 and no fluctuations. Propagation of the beam causes Langmuir waves to be induced after 80 seconds, relating to our choice of T = 20 S. Langmuir wave production increases as a function of time till around 200 seconds after which is remains roughly constant. Figure 22 shows a snapshot of the electric field from the 0 , the electric field has a smooth profile. The increase as a function of time as the range of velocities within the electron beam causes it to spread in space. The electric field iss smaller at the front of the electron beam where the number When An/n is increased the electric field shows the clumpy 2, where N = 1000 is the number of perturbations, no is the of Langmuir waves is induced. initial unperturbed density as defined above, An is the wavelength 4.1.
