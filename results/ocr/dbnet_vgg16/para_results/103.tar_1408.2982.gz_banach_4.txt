ON THE LAST QUESTION OF STEFAN BANACH 5 of Donald L. Webb, a fresh PhD from Caltech and the author of the already mentioned , in which he extends the results of the latter paper. This, among other things, suggests that developments in this branch of logical calculi on both sides of Atlantic did not proceed in isolation at that timel. Earlier, another Lukasiewicz student, Mordchaj Wajsberg has reported at the Lukasiewicz Tarski seminar some related results see a brief description at the very end of . In the same paper, more binary maps generating all maps of arbitrary arity on a finite set are presented without proof. Some of the Wajsberg's results apparently go back as early as 1927, i.e. almost a decade before Webb. More logical calculi, both complete and incomplete, were developed around this time, first of all, by Emil Leon Post , as well as by Eukasiewicz, Slupecki, Boleslaw Sobocinski , Eustachy Zylinski , Zygmunt Zawirski, and others. Post's purely formal treatment of many-valued logics is, perhaps, closer in spirit to mathematical questions considered here than Another feature of the work of Eukasiewicz's school and Polish logicians in general, was the constant quest for minimal, as far as possible, systems of axioms for that or another logical calculus. Minimality was understood both in terms of the number of axioms and their length and 1. Banach's claim and question resonate well with this line of thought, as they can be phrased as follows: if a certain 3-term operation in an m-valued logic is not generated by a 2-term one , the next best thing to ask Of course, many further results about Hilbert's 13th problem, from one side, and functional completeness and incompleteness of various logical calculi, from the other, were obtained afterwards to Warsaw in 1932. Ernest Nagel made public his interesting impressions of visiting Poland in 1935, but, written from the philosopher's rather than logician's standpoint , these impressions, probably, contributed little to interchange of logical and mathematical ideas between the countries. Ulam was moving back and forth between US and Lvov in 1935-1939, but his interests, at least at that time, were outside logic. Webb's thesis advisor, Eric Temple Bell, an enthusiastic, albeit not always precise, writer of popular mathematical books, praised Eukasiewicz's 3-valued logic as one of the four major contributions "on the nature of truth" during the last 6000 years , SO it is, perhaps, not accidental that Webb, a young Professor Lukasiewicz's seminar at Warsaw was crowded with competent young men, incomparably better equipped in logic than students of like age in America, who were expected to write as seminar exercises papers SA quote from : "When Tarski met Emil Post for the first time he told him: 'You are the only logician who achieved something important in propositional calculus without having anything to do with 1 : This fascination with minimal systems of logical axioms was not shared by everyone in Poland. An anti utopian novel Nienasycenie" by Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz , written in 1927 and depicting conquest of Poland by enem forces and establishment there of a totalitarian regime by the end of XX century, features a grotesque figure of logician Afanasol Benz who invented a single axiom that nobody but him coul understand, and from which all mathematics follows by a mere formal combination of symbols . the philosophical attitude of Lukasiewicz. is to extend the 3-term operation SO that it will be generated that way. latter, but their discussion will bring us far away from our main topic. BANACH's CLAIM Californian, published in a relatively obscure Warsaw journal. which elsewhere would be thought important enough for publication", reports Nagel. Poland'. Post answered: Oh, no, I was born in Bialystok' ".
