4.1 7, mirror maps from coassociative fibrations Let us begin by analyzing the generalized 7, mirror symmetry map in the context of TCS G2 manifolds. As the Kovalev CYs X4 admit mirrors by assumption, by the SYZ argument, these have two T° special lagrangian fibrations. Let us denote such fibrations by Lz. In the asymptotically cylindrical region of the manifold X, ~ R*+ x S$! x $4, the SYZ special lagrangians must asymptote to La ~ S! x Ax, where Ay are the SYZ special lagrangian T? fibrations within the asymptotic K3s . In particular, they do not extend along the R* direction. Let us fix the phase of the holomorphic top form on X 4 such that the SYZ special lagrangians are calibrated as follows Notice that a special lagrangian L gives rise to a coassociative cycle Mp = S$! x LC S* x X if and only if it satisfies . In particular, therefore, for our special lagrangians L+ we have Now, Equation entails that the four-cyc »s J 4 = , x La C Jy are such that which entails these are coassociative submanifolds. Since the TCS glueing diffeomorphism = is such that Mx are glued into a coassociative submanifold M C J which has the topology of a T+, which may become singular along loci in J. Performing three T-dualities along the L, SYZ fibres is mapping X, to their mirrors XY by construction. However, as the $+ within the asymptotic CY cylinders are swapped with 25
