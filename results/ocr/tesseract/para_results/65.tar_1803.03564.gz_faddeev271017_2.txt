As in Ref. , let us consider the five-point correlation function with one degenerate field ” Due to the presence of the degenerate field, this correlation function satisfies a partial differential equation, second order in z, first order in x. For the purposes of this section it is convenient to define the function as where the variable wu is related with the variables z and x as all wot. fd K is the elliptic integral of the first ki d and ©; is the Jacobi theta function . The function U defined Eq. satisfies non-stationary Schrodinger equation with doubly periodic potential where the potential V is given by 2u and the parameters s; are related to the param« ers a, 3 In Eq. g is the Weierstra8 elliptic function with periods 7 and m7 defined by the infinite sum
