 seed. Moreover, the exchange polynomial , for d=r =k +1, is by definition true in the initial s 0°,...,0°_, are exactly the ones that appear in a standard cluster algebra of type C, and they are unaffected by mutation : indeed, only the monomials up change, in accordance with the mutations of the exchange matrix. Therefore, clus diameters behave the same way as in a described in . The proof for the firs and . The second equation for k = correspond to a of type C, as those found in er variables that do no standard cluster algebr: case is thus similar to n —1, is also by definition true in the initial seed. Since every cluster contains exactly one variable of the form xq, and any mutation of a variable raz yie diameter, we can deduce from the initial by a mutation in direction n. In the ini ds a variable corresponding to another cluster that all variables x, are linked ial cluster , we have The general relation : . as ae ge _ 0 oe where performing the mutation j1, maps TR gn tO LE o,, and 0? gives Indeed, recall that 6° is unaffected derstand pn, it is enough to know how tained directly in the following cluster by mutation, so that in order to unthe matrix B mutates, namely in the standard way . This determines the variables x. appearing in the monomials u;t and u;, in the mutated cluster above, thus yielding 10
