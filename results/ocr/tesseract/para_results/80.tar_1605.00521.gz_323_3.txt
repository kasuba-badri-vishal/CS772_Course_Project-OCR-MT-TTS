were and The second-order approximation contains a biharmonic operator. We can approximately replace it with a reaction-diffusion system for solutions which are approximately oscillatory in space with one dominant wavenumber k, so that Viu = —k?V7u. Then we have where Div, Di, — k?Quu. If the solutions of interest, or their Laplacians, are not approximate solutions of the Helmholtz equation, this second-order approximation is clearly only a euristic. The direct transformation from system to system or , and its inverse, can be used for searching for nontrivial regimes in the full system, based on the existing experience of nontrivial regimes in the analogues of the reduced systems: 1. Do parametric search in the reduced system, which has fewer parameters and often is easier to compute, as it is less stiff; 2. Once an interesting regime is found, estimate the dominant wavenumber k for it, say as the maximum of the power spectrum of the spatial profile; 3. Use the inverse transformation to obtain parameters for the full system corresponding to the found parameters of the reduced system; 4. See what solutions the full system with these parameters will produce. 3 Results 3.1 Direct transform As a simple example, we now consider a three-component extension of a two-component system with nonlinear kinetics, where a third component is added, which has fast linear kinetics and linked to the other components in a linear way:
