Moreover, let Gep be the class of functions g such that X is a compound Poisson process, GF aC, and The following result which describes the rates of convergence with respect to the prescribed smoothness classes introduced above is a direct consequence of Theorem 3.1. Proposition 3.2. Let K be the sinc-kernel. This is equivalent to stating that FK = Ty-14j Let h* be implicitly defined, as the solution of the minimization equation Then Let h* be the solution of n J Agen 2s e* Let h* be the solution of n e26a? pâ€”2a I a Assume that p > 0 holds anda = 2 Then
