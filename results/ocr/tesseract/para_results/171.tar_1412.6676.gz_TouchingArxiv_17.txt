We claim that q is adjacent to p in Cy. Indeed, conditions C1 and C3 hold trivially. To verify C2, consider a curve e € S2 touching d at a point in the arc of d from q to q’. This touching point lies inside T;. However, e must intersect b, so it must leave T;. It touches a, so it must leave through either b; or ci. Here ci has fewer than 207k points in _X, by our choice of i, while b; contains fewer than a?k points in X, since Case 2 does not hold. Hence, e has fewer than 307k points where it can leave T;, and there are at most 3a?k possible choices for the curve e. This means that condition C2 is satisfied and q is adjacent to p in Cy. By our choice of i, we can select the curve d in at least k/a different ways, each giving rise to a different edge in Cy, incident to p. The total weight of these edges is a. This completes the analysis of the last case, showing that the total weight of all edges in Az, Aj,, Af, By and C;, incident to p is at least a. Summing over all | possible values of k and over all n? touching points in T, we conclude that he total weight of G is at least aflogn n?. Comparing this lower bound with the upper bound proved in the preceding subsection and substituting a = \/logn/loglogn, Theorem 7 follows. References ANJPPSS04 P. K. Agarwal, E. Nevo, J. Pach, R.
