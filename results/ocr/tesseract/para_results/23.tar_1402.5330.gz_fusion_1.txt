THE FUSION CROSS SECTION The energy dependence of the fusion cross section is obtained by folding the barrier distribution provided by Eq., with the classical expression for the fusion cross section by where Rp denotes the relative distance corresponding to the position of barrier approximately, which yields where v and erf€ is the Gaussian error integral of argument €. The arameters By and og along with Rz is to be determined y fitting Eq. along with Eq. to a given fusion exciation function. In the derivation of formula Eq., the quantum effect of sub-barrier tunneling is not accounted or explicitly. However, the influence of the tunneling on shape of a given fusion excitation function is effectively included in the width parameter op. The fusion cross section formula of the Eq. obained by using the diffused-barrier, is a very elegant arametrization of the cross section for a process of overcoming the potential-energy barrier. Hence, it can be successfully used for analysis and predictions of the fusion excitation functions of light, medium and moderately heavy systems, especially in the range of near-barrier energies. The term ‘capture’ is used to refer the process of overcoming the interaction barrier in a nucleus-nucleus collision, followed by formation of a composite system. In general, the composite system undergoes fusion only in a raction f of the capture events. For light and medium systems, f * 1, and almost all the ‘capture’ events lead o fusion resulting fusion cross sections to be practically identical with the capture cross sections. However, for very heavy systems, only a small fraction of ‘capture’ events ultimately lead to fusion while for the remaining part of the events, the system re-separates prior give the capture cross section. IV. CALCULATION AND RESULTS The near-barrier fusion excitation functions of medium and heavy nucleus-nucleus systems have been analyzed using a simple diffused barrier formula derived by folding the Gaussian barrier distribution with the classical expression for the fusion cross section for a fixed barrier. The same set of target-projectile combinations have been selected for which heavy ion sub-barrier fusion has been recently studied. The values of mean barrier height Bo, width op and the effective radius Rg have been obtained using the least-square fit method. These values are listed in Table-I and arranged in order of the increasing value of the Coulomb parameter z = ZZ2/. Since the number of data points for “8Ca+!?4Sn is too low compared to other systems, the error bars for Bo , og and Rg are rather large.
