where the operator D is defined as The expressions we then obtain for the components ti;., ti, Ui, of the flow field a are given in Appendix C. B. First-order solution We now consider the derivation for the first-order solution wu. That flow field contains terms of different frequencies, but we are here only interested in the steady part of the flow. For the sake of simplicity, we use wu to denote to the steady component of this first-order flow. The latter sastifies the following set of equations Vio = 5a Va + a”, Vu =0, Ale where complex conjugate quantities are underlined. In the first-order governing equations, the term w has been dropped since this term is time-dependent and we are only interested in steady flows. Equations and have to be completed by the boundary conditions where the unknown quantity v“ is linked to v' by the relationship In order to obtain the first-order translation speed, we could try to derive the full velocity and stress fields wu“? and o, and integrate the stress over the particle surface to obtain the propulsive force. However, it is more convenient to use a suitable version of the reciprocal theorem, as suggested by Ho & Leal . C. Reciprocal theorem and propulsion speed For the same geometry, we consider now an auxiliary Stokes velocity and stress fields satisfying , , with suitable boundary conditions to be specified below. Subtracting the inner product of equation with w and the inner product of equation with wu, and integrating over the volume of fluid V leads to the equality of virtual powers as Then, using the general vector identity
