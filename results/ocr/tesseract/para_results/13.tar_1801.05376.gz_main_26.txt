v € ext and every n, there is a word x such that |x| > |u,| and rv € ext; since u contains the factor wv, there is an occurrence of v in u outside the prefix u,. Hence v occurs in u infinitely many times. Thus u is recurrent and we proved this implication. Now turn to the backward implication. For arbitrary words u,v € ext each of them occurs in u infinitely often, so we can find a factor of the form wwv. This factor also occurs in u infinitely often, allowing us to find arbitrarily long words x, y such that xuwvy is a factor of u. Then wwv € ext. Hence we proved the Restivo-Salemi property for Liq. Remark 39. It is worth mentioning that for small binary languages Theorem 37 works in an extremal form. Since 2+ < a < 7/3 implies ext = Fac, the language L2,, trivially has the Restivo-Salemi property; as we know from Corollary 3, all a-power-free infinite binary words contain all words of ext as factors. The following conjecture is based on extensive numerical studies. Conjecture 40. All power-free languages satisfy the Restivo-Salemi property. As an approach to Conjecture 40, we suggest the following. Open Question 41. Prove the converse of Corollary 38. References 1 J.-P. Allouche and J. O. Shallit.
