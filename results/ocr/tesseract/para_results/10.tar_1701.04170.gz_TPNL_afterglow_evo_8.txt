NLDSA model for GRB afterglows 9 4, EXAMPLE AFTERGLOWS Having explained the Monte Carlo code and the manner in which it is coupled to a hydrodynamical simulation to create an evolving afterglow model , we will now present the results from three 4.1. Particle spectra and energy densities In Figure 2 we show the spectra of cosmic rays for all three models, in the local plasma frame. For the sake of clarity, the cooled populations that have been swept further downstream are not test cases. The first takes place in the particles accelerate not significantly mo are listed in Table ed particles are ex population, though two models assume that acceleration est-particle limit, with few enough that the structure of the shock is dified. The particular values of Pinj . In one model, thermal . Because we assume only magnetic field compression and no additional amplification, the value of eg just downstream o the shock decays with time as the shock decelerates—see Equation 3—rather than maintaining a constant value a‘ all times. This temporal decay at the shock front occurs in addition to the expected dilution of magnetic energy density as the plasma expands downstream from the shock. ters as defined in Planck Collaboration et al. . 24 Specifically, Robishaw et al. report magnetic field strengths upwards of 10 mG in starburst galaxies from measurements of Zeeman splitting of the 1667 MHz OH megamaser line. Additionally, ambient field strengths within 100-200 pc of the center of the Milky Way may locally reach or exceed mG levels . ion relaxes into isotropy. Since the diffusion length is an increasing function of momentum higherenergy particles remain anisotropic for longer distances downstream. The effects of anisotropic particle distribuions will be addressed in future work; for now we merely note the assumption being made. The spectra presented in Figure 2 do not use arbirary units. Since upstream escape is negligible , and since the difficulty of scattering upstream against a relativistic shock means most particles are downstream, the total number of paricles in each spectrum is the number of particles swept up at a given time step. As such, the spectra are not only absolutely normalized within each model: they are normalized between models as well. Both the CR-only case and TP model result in very simple spectra. This is unsurprising, as they were designed to reproduce the simple power laws used in he standard synchrotron model for afterglows. In the TP model’s spectra, there is a thermal peak?° of particles that crossed the shock once , and a high energy tail of shockaccelerated particles out to a maximum energy. The hermal peak has been excised from the CR-only case, while keeping the normalization of accelerated particles he same. In all cases the spectral index of the proton distributions decreases with time, as the shock Lorentz actor drops . Since protons experience no losses while they ineract with the shock, the high-energy turnover of the CR tail is due to the limit on acceleration time. The electrons, by contrast, experience significant synchrotron osses in the intense magnetic fields downstream of the shock. The slow increase in the maximum energy of the electron spectrum is due to decreased compression also owering the magnetic field and cooling rate. Our Monte Carlo model predicts that protons are easily accelerated beyond the knee in the cosmic ray spectrum; the high magnetic fields, combined with pitchangle scattering, confine the protons to a small volume around the shock, and allow for many shock crossing cycles in the time-limited scenario presented here. The 25 The term “thermal” is used only to specify those shocked particles that don’t enter the Fermi acceleration process. The results we obtain in no way require or presume that these particles equilibrate in a thermodynamic sense.
