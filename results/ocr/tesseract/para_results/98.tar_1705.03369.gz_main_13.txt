Tahle 2Extracted triadic « 1ercies The triadic energies and corresponding error bars are obtained by time averaging the quantity — In p;/g = BE; +n Z for the alliances in EVE Online and for the international relations during the Cold War era . acked and N3 fell apart during the following months. tematically increasing occupation probability for the The gradual disintegration of N3 is reflected ina con triads at the cost of the occupation probabilinuous increase of entropy . This rise of the entropy comes to an end result of the easing of the strained relations between during August-September 2015 by which time the N3__ the blocks of countries . Thus one can identify major change points ive feature in the time series of the entropy is the in each political system from the changes in the enspike in April 2016. This marks the next great war, tropy over time, which the direction of the changes known as “World War Bee” or “The Casino War”, intuitively translating into increased of decreased pohat struck EVE’s virtual world. As a result of this litical stability. war, The Imperium coalition fell apart in mid April 3,1 Model Hamiltonian for SBT 2016. This is clearly visible as a strong rise in the Sy for both types of alliances. : d 3.0.2. Real World data: Syrian Civil War and shown in Table 3 can be used to determine the International relations during the Cold strength parameters for the Hamiltonian of Eq. 6, War as well as the unknown zero level Zp. From this we can learn about the underlying dynamics in the forThe information about the relationships of 21 mation of the triadic relationships. We use the maxiagents involved in the Syrian Civil of Fig. 6 can be mum likelihood method to determine the converted into the occupation probabilities p; for the that has the highest probability of generating the exfour types of triads. Using the geometrical degeneratracted BE; + In Z sets. The likelihood is computed cies gco of Table 1, we obtain the 8E;+81nZ valfrom ues as contained in Table 3. Using data from the Correlates of War project we extracted the times series for the triadic energies and eni tropies . The highest entropy value occurred during the 1962-1964 period that marks the Cuban _. Missile Crisis and the Gulf of Tonkin incident that triggered the USA intervention in Vietnam. The impact of those incidents is also clearly visible in the extracted energies which show a decreasing trend from 1964 onwards. This trend can be attributed to a sys The extracted triadic energies BE; +InZ + ogn, 14
