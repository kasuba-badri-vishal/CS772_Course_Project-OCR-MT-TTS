 Figure 2. Evolution of the pressure along the loop for the pulse duration ty = 60s and ty = 120 s . To emphasize the presence of moving fronts, the pressure is normalized to the mean coronal value at each time, and the grey scale is between 80% and 120% of the mean value. The reasons for this different evolution can be understood from Fig. 3. In both cases we see the initial steep evaporation front coming up from the chromosphere. After this, for ty = 60s , the pressure continues to increase at the loop apex , because plasma accumulates there. However, the pressure does not increase as well low in the loop and as soon as the the heat pulse stops, it even suddenly drops. This depression makes the upper steep pressure front travel backwards along the loop . The pressure drops as the temperature drops, because of conduction cooling. From Fig. 1, he temperature decreases by more than 30% in less than a minute, much less than 7, necessary o equalize the pressure. For ty = 120 s , the heat pulse lasts long enough to sustain the plasma and to equalize the pressure along the whole loop. Therefore, the critical process is whether che pressure equilibrium is reached or not along the loop, which explains why the sound crossing ime is the key parameter. We checked that we find very similar results, i.e., significant plasma sloshing when the heat pulse duration is shorter than 7,, for the longer loop, for the denser initial atmosphere, for heat pulses deposited at the loop footpoints, for the weaker heat pulse. For the triangular pulse, we find that
