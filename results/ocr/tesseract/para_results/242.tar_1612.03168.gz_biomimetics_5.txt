The notation 2+ means the inner/outer limit at the boundary of 0D. More precisely, for a function w defined on R?, one has where v is the outward normal unit vector of OD. 2 The boundary conditions over the skin are a bit more complicated . This is due to the fact that, compared to the water which has a conducFigure 2: Boundary conditions over the skin. tivity of the order of 0.01S-m~! , the skin is very resistive and the body is very conductive . In other words, one has Futhermore, the skin is very thin: if we denote its thickness by 5, we have 6 © 100um < L, where L was defined as the body length in Section . In we have shown in the case d = 2 that, when 6/L < 1 and ks/ky <1, but dky is of order one , we have the following effective relation for x € 00:
