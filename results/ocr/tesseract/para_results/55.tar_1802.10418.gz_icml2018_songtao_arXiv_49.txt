V. where ji is the upper bound of term , | + JAC || and can be obtained by Quantifying the Norm of v“ Projected at Different Subspaces: Then, we will use mathematical induction to prove F It is true when t = 0 since ||| Fo. Assuming that equation is true at the tth iteration, we need to prove Applying into RHS of , we have —- and substituting into LHS of , we have Vv Then, our goal is to prove RHS of is ater than RHS f . After some manipulations, it is sufficient to show Woo In the following, we will show that the above relation is true. First step : We know that where is true because we choose ci,,, = 1 and 7 < ch,,./LmaxSecond step: Also, we know at Vo. tata With the above two steps, we have 9¢+ < 4u, which completes the induction.
