FIG. 3. - Temperature dependence of 7 versus Er plot at A; = OmeV and four different 6. - Temperature dependence of 7 versus Er plot at Ay = 15meV and four diferent in all the eight plots. Other parameters are the same as in Fig.2. and Fig. 1. he Cg, symmetry is broken by the adatom arrangemen' within the clusters. Close to 6 = 7 the deviation from Rashba and the perfect Cg, symmetric situation is small. On the other hand, having — < 8 < 0 requires a strong reaking of the Cg, symmetry. In Fig. 1, we show the dependence of the spin Hal angle y and the transport cross section Uj. at zero temerature on the carrier energy E for different values o rength of the scalar potential vo = Ao/R? or a rather anisotropic Rashba-like SOC corresponding o 8 = —7/8. It can be seen that the enhancement o ne spin Hall angle still takes place around the values f E for which ¥j, exhibits a peak, that is, a scatering resonance. This is in agreement with what was already pointed out in Ref. 10 for the isotropic Rashba SOC. Physically, this is also expected, because at resonance the scattering electron or hole spends most time near the scatterer and therefore it can also experience he effect of the locally induced SOC. The enhancement of ¥ is suppressed at large values of vo. To understand his effect qualitatively, let us recall that y and Dj, are poth determined by the T-matrix, which obeys the LS equation: w ° where Gr is the retarded Green’s function and V =VW+Vsoc, Vo & vo being the scalar potential and Vsoc = Vi + Vr the SOC part of the potential. In the limit where Vo >> Vsoc, the solution to Eq. can be written as: | where the last expression applies to the large Vo limit. Thus, to leading order, the cross section if, is determined by the first term of the right hand-side, whereas y is determined by the the second term. Hence, y is expected to decrease at large Vo « vo, as shown in Fig. 1. For a given set of vo, Ay, and Agr, Fig. 2 shows the behaviour of y and Xj, as a function of the incident electron energy F at different values of anisotropy parameter 3. For the values of 6 close to those corresponding to the non-standard Rashba SOC , the energy dependence is strongly modified. On the other hand, for the case of a delta function potential, the anisotropy has a less pronounced effect on the cross section Uf... The observations made above remain largely unchanged when the effect of finite temperature is taken into account, see Fig 3. As shown there, thermal fluctuations and the associated smearing of the Fermi distribution, smooth out the sharper features of the energy lependence Ey of y found at T = 0 and suppress the magnitude of y. This can be seen in the left panel in Fig. 3 for case of a pure anisotropic Rashba SOC and on the right for A; # 0. The plots on the left panel also illustrate that, 6 = 0 the spin current as well as the spin Hall angle vanish . This is because the quantization axis for the spin current is aligned along the z axis, whereas for 6 = 0, sy commutes with the Hamiltonian. As pointed out above for T = 0, the energy dependence , is most strongly affected as 3 approaches —4 . However, the effect of the anisotropy is less pronounced for 3 > 0. This conclusion still holds true when the scatterer also induces intrinsic SOC on the graphene layer , as it is shown in the right panel of Fig. 3. Finally, it is also worth mentioning that the observation of a very different energy dependence as 6 — —7 is independent of the assumption of a Dirac delta potential. This is investigated in detail in Appendix , where circular scatterer is assumed and the scattering properties in the the case of standard and nonstandard Rashba are obtained. The results for the energy dependence of 7 and Sj, are displayed in Fig. 4. The more complicated internal structure of the finite-radius circular scatter, whose wave functions are distorted in different ways by the standard and non-standard Rashba SOC, shows up in a very different resonant peak structure exhibited by the transport cross section Uj, and the nan
