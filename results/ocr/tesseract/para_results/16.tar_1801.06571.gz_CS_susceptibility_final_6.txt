FIG. 5. The ladder series of diagrams for the static susceptibility ite The exact y is represented as a series M =0,1,2,... of bubbles comprised of Green’s functions with poles on opposite halves of the complex frequency plane, i.e. whose contributions are computed close to the FS. pole and a branch cut. A pole can be avoided by closing the integration contour in the appropriate frequency halfplane, but the branch cut is unavoidable, and its presence renders the frequency integral finite. Since there is no splitting, relevant fermionic w, and k are not confined to the FS and are generally of order Ep . Fermions at such high energies have a finite damping, i.e., are not fully coherent quasiparticles. By this reason, the M = 0 contribution to xf one, x6_, = nie . is labeled as an incoherent We next move to the MM = 1 sector. Here we select the subset of diagrams with one cross-section, in which we pick up the contribution from GG from the range where the poles in the two Green’s functions are in different half-planes of complex frequency. The sum of such diagrams can be graphically represented by the skeleton diagram in Fig. labeled M=1. The internal part of this diagram gives Z?x1,0, where xi,0 is given by . The side vertices contain AS 2 , ie. the product of the bare form-factor , and the contributions from all other cross-sections, in which GG is approximated by G?. These contributions would vanish if we used a static U for the interaction, but again become non-zero once we include dynamical screening at order U? and higher. Similarly to the M = 0 sector, the difference Aet — 1 is determined by fermions with energies of order Ey. Note, however, that in the M = 0 sector, all internal energies are of order Hy. In the M = 1 sector, internal energies for the vertices Ace are of order Ep, but external w, are infinitesimally small, and external k are on the FS. Overall, the contribution to the static susceptibility from the 14 = 1 sector is Row det Sectors with M = 2, M = 3 are the subsets of diagrams with 2,3,... cross-sections in which we split the poles of the Green’s functions with equal frequencies and momenta separated by q. In the cross-sections in between the selected ones GG is again approximated by G?. The contribution from the M = 2 sector is represented by the skeleton diagram in Fig. labeled M = 2. It contains fully dressed side vertices Ace and a fully dressed anti-symmetrized static interaction between fermions on the FS. One can easily verify that this interaction appears with the prefactor Z?, ie., the extra factor in the M = 2 sector compared to M = 1 is the product of x;,9 and the corresponding component of the Landau function. Using we then obtain a rr A simple bookkeeping analysis shows that contributions from sectors with larger M form a geometric series, which transform 1 — Fel into 1/, Collecting all contributions, we reproduce Eq. . 3. The susceptibility xe at finite Q/vp|q|. We now extend the analysis to the case when both transferred momentum q and transferred frequency 2 are vanishingly small, but the ratio Q/v|q| is finite. The computational steps are the same as for static susceptibility. The contribution to x from the M = 0 sector and the vertex function Ace do not depend on the ratio of 2 and remain the same as in the static case. However, the integrand in the expression for x1i,0, Eq. , now contains a non-trivial angular dependence via vr|q| cos dx . This makes the computation of series with M = 1,2,... more involved. Consider first the limit Q < vp|q|. For even I, the free-fermion susceptibility is where aq; = 1 if! = 0 and q, = 2 ifl = 2m, m > 0. For odd I, the expansion in 2 starts with 2?. The total contribution from the M = 1 sector still is proportional to Xi,0: nan
