’ Currently at: Center for Underground Physics, Institute for Basic Science, Daejeon 34126, Korea The charm semileptonic decays Dt + ne+y. and Dt -> n’e+y. are studied with a sample of ete” collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.93 fb~! collected at s = 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector. We measure the branching fractions for D+ — netve to be x 10~*, and for Dt + n/etve to be x 1074, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. In addition, we perform a measurement of the form factor in the decay Dt — netv.. All the results are consistent with those obtained by the CLEO-c experiment. Keywords: BESIII, charm semileptonic decay, form factor I. INTRODUCTION Charm semileptonic decays involve both the cequark weak decay and the strong interaction. In the Standard Model, the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix describes the mixing among the quark flavors in the weak decay. The strong interaction effects in the hadronic current are parameterized by a form factor, which is numerically calculable with Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics . The differential decay rate for the charm SL decay D+ > netv-, neglecting the positron mass, is given by where Gr is the Fermi constant, V.q is the relevant CKM matrix element, j;, is the momentum of the 7 meson in the D+ rest frame, and f is the form factor arametrizing the strong interaction dynamics as a funcion of the squared four-momentum transfer q?, which is the square of the invariant mass of the e+-v, pair. Precise measurements of the SL decay rates provide input ‘o constrain the CKM matrix element V.g and to test the heoretical descriptions of the form factor. LQCD calcuations of the form factor can be tested by comparing to he ones determined from the partial branching fraction measurements, once the CKM matrix element Vig is known. Moreover, the mixing 17-7’ or 7-7/-G, where G stands for a glueball, is of great theoretical interest, because it concerns many aspects of the underlying dynamics and hadronic structure of pseudoscalar mesons and gluepalls . The SL decay Dt > ety, can be used to study the 7-7’ mixing in a much cleaner way than in hadronic processes due to the absence of final-state ineraction . Based on a data sample with an integrated luminosiy of 818pb~* collected at s = 3.77GeV, the CLEO collaboration measured the BF for D+ + netv. and Dt + nletye to be Byety, = x 10-4 and Byet+y, = x 10-4 , respectively. In this paper, we present new measurements of these BFs, using DD meson pairs produced near threshold at \/s = 3.773GeV with an integrated luminosity of 2.93fb~1 collected with the BESIII detector . In addition, the modulus of the form factor f in D+ — ne*v, is measured. II. THE BESIII DETECTOR The Beijing Spectrometer detects e+e~ collisions produced by the double-ring collider BEPCII. BESIII is a general-purpose detector with 93% coverage of the full solid angle. From the interaction point to the outside, BESIII is equipped with a main drift chamber consisting of 43 layers of drift cells, a time-of-flight counter with double-layer scintillator in the barrel part and single-layer scintillator in the end-cap part, an electromagnetic calorimeter composed of 6240 CsI crystals, a superconucting solenoid magnet providing a magnetic field of 1.0T along the beam direction, and a muon counter c ontaining multi-layer resistive plate chambers installe in the steel flux-return yoke of the magnet. The MDC spatial resolution is about 135m and the momentum resolution is about 0.5% for a charged track with transverse momentum of 1 GeV/c. The energy resolution for electromagnetic showers in the EMC is 2.5% at 1GeV. More details of the spectrometer can be found in Ref. . Ill. MC SIMULATION Monte Carlo simulation serves to estimate the detection efficiencies and to understand background components. High statistics MC samples are generated with a GEANT4-based software package, which includes simulations of the geometry of the spectrometer and interactions of particles with the detector materials. KKMC is used to model the beam energy spread and the initialstate radiation in the ete~ annihilations . The ‘inclusive’ MC samples consist of the production of DD pairs with consideration of quantum coherence for all neutral D modes, the non-DD decays of 1, the ISR production of low mass w states, and continuum process nan
