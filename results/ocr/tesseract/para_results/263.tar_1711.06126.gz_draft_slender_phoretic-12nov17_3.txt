Non-dimensionalization We express the displacements in terms of half the length of the swimmer, . We consider swimmers with concentration gradients generated by the colloids on a scale c*/a. Hence we express the flux J of reactant articles in units of c*D/a, the concentration field ¢ in units of c*, , the interaction energy WV in the units of thermal energy kgT, , the flow field ¥ with U* = p*c*/a molecules with the swimmer surface. We scale the pressure field p with 7U*/1. We note that the problem has three length-scales; the swimmer characteristic length 21, its cross-sectional radius a and the range L* of the interaction between the molecules and swimmer surface. Consequently, we have three asymptotic near-field regions and in addition the scale on which the ends of the rod are rounded. We therefore define the dimensionless parameters, « = a/l, the slenderness ratio and A = L*/I, the interaction ayer thickness to the swimmer largest lengthscale, with 0 < 1 « € < 1. In addition, we define dimensionless fields J = Ja/eD, c=¢/c*, v = 6/U*, p = pl/nU*, & = keT, and the dimensionless catalytic flux a = aa/c*D on he swimmer surface. where A = L*/I is the ratio of the interaction length-scale to half the length of the swimmer, € = a/I is the swimmer slenderness ratio and 7,z is the short-range interaction potential between reactant molecules and surface. and the concentration decays to its value far from the swimmer, ¢ > Cx, Vr? + 22 > 00. The zero torque and force conditions are where II = —pl+ is the dimensionless stress tensor and dS, dV are the surface and volume elements in cylindrical coordinates respectively. C.
