Proton instabilities in weakly collisional plasmas 3 may be expressed by transport coefficients which are typically derived in the vicinity of thermal equilibrium . A presence of other kinetic effects may render questionable these collision-dominated theoretical predictions diverge. Some collisional transport coefficients can be calculated even far from thermal equilibrium, for example assuming drifting bi-Maxwellian velocity distribution functions for all particle species . For instance the proton-proton isotropization frequency Vpp may be given as where 2F; is the standard hypergeometric function. In collisionless plasmas kinetic instabilities lead to effective transport coefficients. In the quasi-linear approximation it is possible to derive some of the transport coefficients assuming the particle velocity distribution function is close to biMaxwellian. The behavior of a driven system with Coulomb collisions and temperature anisotropydriven instabilities is a complex nonlinear problem which is hard to investigate analytically so that a numerical approach is needed. In this paper we investigate expansion driven proton temperature anisotropies in high beta, weakly collisional plasmas. In high beta plasmas there are two dominant instabilities driven by the proton emperature anisotropy. For T,1 > Tp it is the mirror instability . This instability is resonant through the Landau resonance. This kinetic feature is combined with fluid properties, the unstable waves are nonpropagating and have long wavelengths near threshold. The nonlinear properies of the mirror instability are not fully understood, as they seem to combine kinetic properties and a fluid nonlinearity . For T,, < T, the dominant growing mode is is the oblique fire hose instability . This instability is resonant through he cyclotron resonance and generates transient nonpropagating modes which eventually become propagating and damped . Other instabilities may also play an important role in regulating the proton temperature anisotropy. This paper is organized as follows: section describes the numerical code, section presents the simulation results for one simulation for the parallel proton temperature anisotropy T1 < Tp\ and one for the perpendicular anisotropy T,1 > T\. The simulaions results are summarized and discussed in section . 2. Expanding box model Here we use the expanding box model implemented to the hybrid code developed by Matthews to study a response of a weakly collisional plasma to a slow expansion. In this Collisional Hybrid Expanding Box model the expansion is described as an external force. This model was developed in the context of the radial
