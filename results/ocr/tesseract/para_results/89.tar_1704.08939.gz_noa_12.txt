crystal without time-reversal symmetry. Once again, we emphasize that this effect would be absent in the linear approximation of the energy spectrum around the Weyl nodes. E. Reversal of the direction of light propagation Thus far, we have assumed that the direction of light propagation is along the positive z direction. If the direction of propagation is reversed, the roles of LCP and RCP are exchanged and consequently the valley polarization is reversed. In other words, LCP and RCP are exchanged in Figs. |7| and |9| while the small and large black circles are exchanged in Figs. and Iv. ANALYTICAL RESULTS The objective of this section is to support and supple In this approximation, only m = 0,+1 channels contribute to the effective electron-hole attraction. Out of these, only the m = +1 are active under irradiation by LCP and RCP lights. In addition, Eq. becomes independent of the interaction strength because g/k2 is independent of g in the Thomas-Fermi approximation. Finally, the interaction kernel is separable into “primed” and “non-primed” variables, which will enable an analytical solution of the corresponding Wannier equation. In fact, the problem at hand becomes a variation of the Cooper problem in the BCS theory of superconductivity=4l Let us consider the m = 0 channel first. Dividing both parts of Eq. 40 by |—€nm=o,r , multiplying by sin@, and intek, we arrive at the condition where we have taken the zero temperature limit, and €r < 0 . Besides, for simplicity, we have neglected the self-energy correction to the energy bands, so that |B,| > |B,|. We remind the reader that the integrals over momenta are constrained by the condition |B, | < A . Equation gives the electron-hole excitation energies corresponding to m = 0, at the valley 7. Proceeding in the same way, we find that the excitation energies for the m = +1 channels must obey 13 ment the numerical results of the preceding section with a simplified analytical solution of Eq. , which studied twoelectron bound states. The main simplification consists of replacing the screened Coulomb potential in real space by a delta function potential. This approximation is valid at length scales that far exceed the screening length, i.e., for momenta that are small compared to the ThomasFermi screening wave vector k,. If k, is large compared to the momentum cutoff of the model , but still small compared to the separation between the Wey nodes, then we can approximate Eq. as | . In order to obtain approximate analytical solutions of and . by recognizing that J yey °0|. Applying , the latter become where jy, = Eq. to Eqs. where p- density of states at it 6 is the valley-resolved E and In
