FIG. 1. Phase diagram of the classical Hamiltonian for N = 3 colors and disorder distribution with Jn = 1, Ji = 0.25, and c = 0.5. The dots and triangles mark the numerically determined transitions between the Baxter, product, and paramagnetic phases. The solid lines are guides to the eye only. The dashed line marks €. = 1.281 which separates the weak and strong coupling regimes in the strong-disorder renormalization group calculations. where denotes the thermodynamic average and ais is the disorder average. In addition, we also measure the 24 the corresponding product susceptibility xp, and the product Binder cumulant gp. The phase diagram of the classical Hamiltonian resulting from these simulations is shown in Fig. 1. In the weak-coupling regime, € < €¢, we find a direct transition between the magnetically ordered Baxter phase at low temperatures and the paramagnetic high-temperature phase. For strong coupling, «€ > €,., these two phases are separated by a product phase. In the following, we study the critical behaviors of the transitions separating these phases in detail, and we compare them to the renormalization group predictions. B. Weak coupling regime In the weak-coupling regime, € < €¢, we perform simulations for coupling strengths ¢ = 0, 0.3 and 0.5 employing the Wolff and Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithms as discussed above. Because the disorder breaks the symmetry between the space and time directions in the Hamiltonian , the finite-size scaling analysis of the data to find the critical exponents becomes more complicated. This is caused by the fact that the system sizes L and L, in the space and time directions are expected to have different scaling behavior. Thus, the correct aspect ratios L,/L of the samples to be used in the simulations are not known a priori. To overcome this problem we follow the iterative method employed in Refs. 45-48 which is based on the Binder cumulant. As the renormalization group calculations predict infinite-randomness criticality with activated dynamical scaling, the scaling form of the Binder cumulant reads Here r = T. denotes the distance from criticality, X, is a scaling function, and 7 and v refer to the tunneling and correlation length critical exponents. L? is a microscopic reference scale. For fixed L, gay has a maximum as function of L; at position LP and value gi**. The position of the maximum yields the optimal sample shape for which the system sizes L and L; behave as the correlation lengths € and &. At criticality L; must thus behave as In ~ LY, fixing the second argument of the scaling function X,. Consequently, the peak value git** is independent of L at criticality, and the gay vs. r curves of optimally shaped samples cross at T = T,.. Once the optimal sample shapes are found, finite-size scaling proceeds as usual.495° To test our simulation and data analysis technique, we first consider the case « = 0 for which the quantum Ashkin-Teller model reduces to three decoupled random transverse-field Ising chains whose quantum phase transition is well understood.* We perform simulations for sizes L = 10 to 50 and L; = 2 to 20000 and find a critical temperature T, ~ 1.24. At this temperature, we confirm the activated scaling of the Binder cumulant with the expected value y = 1/2. We also confirm the scaling of the magnetization at T,, , m~ L~9/" with 6 = 0.382 and v = 2. After this successful test, we now turn to the AshkinTeller model proper. We perform two sets of simulations: € = 0.5 using system sizes L = 10 to 60, Ly, = 2 to 60000 and « = 0.3 with system sizes L = 10 to 50, L;, = 2 to 40000. In each case, we start from a guess for the optimal shapes and find an approximate value of T, from the crossing of the gay vs. T' curves for different L. We then find the maxima of the gay vs. Ly curves at this temperature which yield improved optimal shapes. After iterating this procedure two or three times, we obtain T. and the optimal shapes with reasonable precision. Figure 2 shows the resulting Binder cumulant g,, for e€ = 0.5 as function of L; for different L at the approximate critical temperature of T, = 2.08. As expected at T,, the maxima g'"** of these curves are independent of L . Moreover, the figure shows that the ga, vs. L;, domes rapidly become broader with increasing spatial size L, indicating non-power-law scaling. To analyze this quantitatively, we present a scaling plot of these data in Fig. 3. For conventional power nan
