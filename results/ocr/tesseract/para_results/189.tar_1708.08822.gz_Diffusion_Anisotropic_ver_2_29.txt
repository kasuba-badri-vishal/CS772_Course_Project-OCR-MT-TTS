In and we replaced T with rp, by using to simplify the expression. Thus, the diffusivities are and the butterfly velocities are , ’ Finally, by noticing that tz = ~! we have Notice that the €, and €, depend only on z and € irrespective of @ and ¢. They are also independent of charge density p and momentum relaxations k; and kg. This universality is nontrivial because the thermal conductivities, specific heat and butterfly velocity, all of them depend on through . When it comes to the combinations €, and Ey, all L,, £1, Ly and rp, are canceled out. To investigate if there is any lower or upper bound of €, and €,, we need to understand the parameter region of z and €. We will restrict ourselves to positive z;. Based on the allowed parameter region obtained in section we find e Class I and I where € = x. e Class Li — 29 —
