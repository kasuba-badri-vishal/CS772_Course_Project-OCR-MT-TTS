 Table 3: Dual-continuum background. Numerical results of relative errors at the final simulation time. DOF; = + km and Qz = 920: Km. using RVE computations. This is based on a localization assumption, which we introduce neat. We consider H”, which is the harmonic expansion in w, which is defined by solving local problems in each K. We can use THE" On D to approximate the elements of the stiffness matrix. Our localization assumption uses the local snapshots computed in the RVE for each w;, which we denote by RVE;. We denote these RVE snapshots by @ be inet Then, we propose the following localization assumption | KVH" « VH dot | BV HPVE RYE yet WRF dey, D D 3.2 Numerical simulation of the shale gas transport In this section, we add a case study for our method. We follow the example considered in , where a shale gas transport with dual-continuum is studied. In inorganic matter, we have de 5 Pig = divVe 10. 16
