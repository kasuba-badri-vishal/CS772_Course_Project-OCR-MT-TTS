70 In fact, if ysm € 1,3 for some vp < m <n, then the PU packet is successfully decoded in slot m; similarly, if ys, € 5,6,7 for some vp < _m <n, then the PU packet becomes connected to the root of the CD graph. Specializing to this case and using , we need to prove the recursion In fact, if yn € 1, 2, the root is successfully decoded and the full CD potential is released, resulting in The new root of the CD graph becomes ps = n+1 , with CD potential , so that Otherwise, the root of the CD graph remains unchanged, ps = ps, with CD potential , and no SU packets are decoded, so that Mgni1 = Msn. It follows that May 27, 2020 DRAFT
