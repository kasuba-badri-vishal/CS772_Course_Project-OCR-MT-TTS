Variety of idempotents in nonassociative algebras Ver.: Sun 31°* May, 2020, 00:175 y Pp g' which is naturally identified with a corresponding element 4 € V* @V* @V. If e = e1,...,€n is an arbitrary basis in A, where n = dimg A, then 4 induces a K-quadratic polynomial map U4 : K" — K” defined by where € is the coordinatization map n = nie, : K" 4 A, w= € K”. i=1 In this setting, V4 is a bilinear map on K”. Then an element c = ¢ € A is idempotent if and only if the corresponding « € K” is a fixed point of U4, i.e. It is convenient to consider the projectivization of the latter system. Namely, let WE = Wa — xox, where X = € K"*1. The modified equation is homogeneous of degree 2. By the made assumption on K, we can consider both and as equations over the complex numbers. Furthermore, defines a variety in CP”. Clearly, if x solves then X = is a solution of , and, conversely, X = solves with a 4 0 then st is a solution of . In the exceptional case xo = 0, one has ® = 0, ie. e is a 2-nilpotent in A. In summary, there exists a natural bijection between the set P and all solutions of in CP”. In this picture, 2nilpotents correspond to the ‘infinite’ part of solutions of with x = 0. Then the classical Bezdut’s theorem implies the following dichotomy: either there are infinitely many solutions of or the number of distinct solutions is less or equal to 2", where n = dimx A. Therefore if the set P is finite then necessarily We point out that one should interpret a solution to in the projective sense.
