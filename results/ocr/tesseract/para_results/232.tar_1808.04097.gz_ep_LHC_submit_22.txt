at the LO QCD corrections can be found from Eq. . Since Qi2 mix with the QCD and EW penguin operators, i.e. @Q3-10, we basically need the 10 x 10 ADM matrix for the operators Q1-19. Since the mixture of Qi. and Q3-19 is dominated by the QCD penguin operators, we adopt the ¢ <6 ADM for the new physics effects, and the A™M is given as : with f being the number of flavors. If we take the operators Qi_¢ as a basis, from Eq. , the corresponding Wilson coefficients can form a vector and be expressed as Cp = ¢4" and Ch, = C#* at the my, scale. Using RG evolution with ADM in Eq. , the Wilson coefficients at the m, scale can be obtained as: where we have ignored the effects that are less than or around +0.1, and C/, can be obtained from Cr using C2" instead of CAP. Similarly, we can apply the same approach to the Qosien operators. From the Hamiltonian in Eq. , the Wilson coefficients at the 4 = maz, scale can be formed as Cebu — CEP and C’S42" = ¢8%4. Using the ADM in Eq. , the Wilson coefficients at j: = m, can then be obtained as: We can obtain C’S44" from C54"" using G2” instead of CEP. Following Eqs. and and using the introduced matrix elements, the Re from the tree-level diquark contributions can be formulated as: 23
