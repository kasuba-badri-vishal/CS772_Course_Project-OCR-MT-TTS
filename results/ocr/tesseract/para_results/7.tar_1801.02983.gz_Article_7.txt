While a is fixed at 2 A~!, 6 is taken at the three different values 0.1, 0.3, and 1.02 A corresponding to increasing couplings between the R and ¢ coordinates in the interaction region. E is kept at 0.5 eV, j, at 0, pp at 2/3 amu, m at 1/2 amu and r at 1 A. R, and Ry are both taken at 4 A, beyond which V is negligibly small and the integrand in Eq. is a constant of motion. The collisional systems resulting from the previous parameters involve strong interferences, as shown by the exact quantum state distributions Pj, ;, = |9j.j,|? displayed in Fig. 1 . Since J; = 0, we note from Eq. that $1 = ¢1. For 6 = 0, there is no coupling between R and ¢ and J keeps constantly equal to hj; during the collision. Calling t the time to go from R, to the interaction region and back to Rz, we have Using Eq. , we thus arrive at with P; given by Eq. . From Eqs. , and the fact that t does not depend on ¢ , we obtain te th is represented in Fig. 2 for 6 = 0 and the three values previously considered. For 6 equal 0.1, the coupling is small and ae A slightly oscillates around 1. For 6 equal 0.3, the coupling is stronger, thus leading to oscillations around 1 of larger amplitude. In both cases, however, da hh is found to be positive. Hence, the SC-Iand SC-I* approaches lead ik
