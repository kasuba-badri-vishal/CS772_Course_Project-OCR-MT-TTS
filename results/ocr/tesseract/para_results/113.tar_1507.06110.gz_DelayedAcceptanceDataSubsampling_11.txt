DELAYED ACCEPTANCE MCMC BY DATA SUBSAMPLING 12 Sherlock et al. study the statistical efficiency for delayed acceptance random walk Metropolis and, moreover, an efficiency that also takes into account the computational efficiency for the case where the target is estimated . Christen and Fox note that, because the transition kernels of both the MH and delayed acceptance MH are derived from the same proposal q,, and in addition az < 1, the delayed acceptance MH will be less statistically efficient than MH. The intuition is that under these conditions the chain clearly exhibits a more “sticky” behavior and an estimate based on these samples will have a larger asymptotic variance under DA-MH than MH. Notice that the closer a2 is to 1, the more statistically efficient the delayed acceptance algorithm is, and when ag = | it is equivalent to the standard MH which gives the upper bound of the possible statistical efficiency achieved by a DA-MH. Result 1 in Payne and Mallick gives the alternative formulation G3 | Let In = ls ls and denote by im the estimate of 1 = Sry le. Similarly to , where gx = U% — qx and the ¢;’s are iid with 1 Pr = es with Dy = — Ue fori =1,...m. We can also show that
