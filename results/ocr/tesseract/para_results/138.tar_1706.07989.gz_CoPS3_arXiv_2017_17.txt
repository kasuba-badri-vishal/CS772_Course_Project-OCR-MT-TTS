Table 3: Ordered moments from refining the low-temperature data from D10 and D23 using Irep. Two refinements were performed: one constraining the moments to lie only along a; and a second with the moments free in the plane. The residuals for each refinement are also shown. All moment values are given in fig. Note that both nuclear and magnetic Bragg peaks were measured and that the refinements included both nuclear and magnetic structures. most likely present. A schematic of the magnetic structure for CoPS3 is shown in figure 7. The originally published structure is shown in figure 7, while the results for the current refinement are shown in figure 7. The current refinement results in a structure that is qualitatively identical to that for NiPS3 . The temperature dependence of the Bragg peak was followed as a function of temperature to quantify the critical behaviour of the sublattice magnetization in CoPS3. The results are shown in figure 8. The Bragg peak intensity decreases as a power law with an exponent of 23 = 0.60 + 0.01 close to Ty, which was established to be 119.1 + 0.1 K in the analysis. The exponent was determined from fitting data in the temperature range 109 < T < Ty, or from a reduced temperature < 0.085. The exponent is roughly similar to that expected for a phase transitions in a threedimensional material, suggesting that CoPS3 may be less two-dimensional than some of the other members of the MPS3 family. The temperature dependence is remarkably similar to that observed for NiPS3, with the same exponent within approximately the same reduced temperature range. 18
