4 KAZUHIRO ICHIHARA, MAKOTO OZAWA, AND J. HYAM RUBINSTEIN FIGURE l. Claim 2. There are no compressing disks for Sy M4 in H. Proof. If such a compressing disk exists in Hj, then there exists a compressing disk in S$, M, in H for t < ¢ by Claim 1, contradicting the assumption that the first compressing disk for Sy 1M, in H appears for t! > f. Thus the side MM_ must be where the first compressing disk in Hh appears at the level t . That is, Sy 9 M_ has a compressing disk in H. Then, there are no compressing disks for Sy 1 Mz in H®, for S is strongly irreducible. Together with Claim 2, we conclude that, for t > f and t’ very close to f, there are no compressing disks for Sy 1 M4 in M4, i.e., Sy My, is incompressible in M4. Also, at the level t , there cannot be any compressing disks in $,9.M_ in H?. Because if such a compressible disk exists, then it gives a compressing disk in Sy O.M_ in Hf by Claim 1, contradicting that $9 M_ does not have compressing disks on both sides. Also, at the level t, there cannot be any compressing disks in S$, .M_ in H, for the first compressing disk for Sy M_ in H, appears for t’ > a We conclude that there cannot be any compressing disks for S$; M_ in M_ at the level t, ie., S; M_ is incompressible in M_. This gives the second case of the theorem. Finally the third case occurs when $M, has no compressing disk in H for t very close to ¢ and t < ¢. In this case, there are no compressing disk for $; M4 in H, for the first compressing disk for Sy 7M, in Hj appears for t’ > é. This implies that S; M4 is incompressible in M1. In the same way, S;M M_ has no compressing disk in H. Claim 3. There are no compressing disks for SA M_ in H?. Proof. If such a compressing disk exists for S,; M_ in H?, then it extends to a compressing disk in Sy M_ in H® for t > é by Claim 1. This gives a contradiction to the strong irreducibility of the splitting in the case that the first compressing disk at the level t’ > ¢ appears in the M, side . Therefore we conclude that, for t < ¢ and t arbitrarily close to f, there are no compressing disks for either S;9 M4 or $,9 M_. nan
