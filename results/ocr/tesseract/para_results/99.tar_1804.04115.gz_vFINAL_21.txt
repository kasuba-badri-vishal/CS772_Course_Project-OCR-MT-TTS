MCF WITH SURGERY FOR LOW ENTROPY HYPERSURFACES 22 Since by lemma 2.5 the entropy for a compact hypersurface will be attained by an F functional centered in its convex hull, without loss of generality x is in the convex hull of M#. Since for such x we have |x — 2o| < D < 00”, we see for a lower —|2—a29|? . 2 bound ¢ on r we have Ve~ |< 2 < oo for any choice of « € Mr. Denote this upper bound by p. We also note similarly for r > c that the Gaussian weight of a F,,,, functional _p2 is bounded below by em > 0; denote this lower bound by o. Also denote by mz. and M,,,, the minimum and maximum respectively of the Gaussian weight of F,,, in Ue. Then the following is true: Since o > 0 and p < oo we can make this quotient as close to one as we like by making r, sufficiently small; in other words we can make the ratio of the minimum to the maximum of the weight in these F’ functionals as close to 1 as we want in U. by increasing Hneck. Switching to the translated and rescaled picture the ratio persists under rescaling’ we have for x € U y and for r > c; the following: ?of course, the diameter is decreasing under the flow so is uniformly bounded by the diameter of the initial time slice
