in Fig. 10. Even if the entire Fermi surface is taken into account the selection rules still work in the Fe-based materials. For instance, in either case full cancellation is found for By, symmetry”. Explicitly written out, the fermionic loop is given by22-24-41 uf where 7 is the form factor , and G; is the electron propagator on band: =T, X, Y. &p is the electronic energy and Q is the energy difference etween the incoming and scattered photons. Experimentally, pure symmetries can be obtained from linear combinations of the response measured at appropriate olarizations of the incoming and scattered photons é; and é,. For illustration purposes the fermionic loop @ is aproximated in the hot-spot approximation. Hot-spots are regions in momentum space where both k and k+ qe ie on the Fermi surface . Since the loop @ contains the symmetry factor y linearly inside the momentum integral the sign of y is crucial. If y changes sign for different hot spots connected by qe , , and for Aig, Big, Bag, respectively here will be full or partial cancelation within @. Full cancelation is observed for the first two orders of By, symmetry . In contrast, 7 does not change sign across different hot-spots for the By, channel. Consequently, in By, and Bo, the fluctuaions are Raman active and inactive, respectively. The Aj, symmetry is more complicated in that the first order contribution, proportional to cos +cos upper row of Fig. 10, would be as strong as the By, contribution whereas the second order contribution cos shows cancelation. For clarifying the relative magnitude of the two orders we analyze the effective mass vertices on the Fermi surfaces , that are the best approximations for the sensitivity away from resonances, in a way similar to what was proposed in Ref. 28. The last row of Fig. 10 shows that the band curvatures corresponding to the Ai, vertex on the Fermi surface of the hole and the electron bands are predomininantly negative and positive, respectively, as expected already for simple parabolic bands with masses m, * —me, although there are various near nodes on both bands. This result shows that cos cos is the leading order. We note that cos cos predicts a stronger mixing of the particlehole response from the electron and hole bands than cos + cos as already outlined by Mazin et al. Ref. 28. Appendix E: Subtraction of the continuum The fluctuation response is superposed on the particlehole continuum that essentially reflects symmetry-resolved transport properties®!. Since the contribution of the fluctuations is relatively strong here they can be isolated with little uncertainty. The simplest way is to use the continuum at or slightly above the crossover temperature T; and subtract it from all spectra measured below T;. This was sufficient for ErTe3*? but created negative intensities in the case of Lag_,Sr,CuO4**. Here, we wish to compare the temperature dependence of the fluctuations to a theoretical prediction and have to improve on the subtraction of the continuum. To this end we make the analytical phenomenology for the B,, continuum temperature dependent in a way that yields « p. This seems sensible since the proportionality holds for the Aj, results in the entire temperature range above Tspw and for the By, spectra above T;. Fig. 11 shows the steps and checks necessary for the procedure. The analytical function used reads - which obeys xont = —xeone as required by causality. a1, 2, 3, and 82 depend only on doping x. For x = 0.025 we used ay = 0.82379, a2 = —0.00138, By = —0.00923, and 82 = 0.00028. T'o is a fitting parameter that is selected in a way that the inverse slope T. of xfone follows the resistivity . If a constant continuum is used the fluctuations can be isolated in a qualitatively similar fashion. However, the experimental data in Fig. 2 vary more slowly close to T,. Below T, the uncertainties increase since surface layers accumulate rapidly in the presence of twin boundaries where the surface assumes a more polar character. This can be seen directly in Fig. 6 . Appendix F: Initial slope For being a causal function the Raman response is antisymmetric and, as long as there is no gap, linear around the origin. Then Eq. can be approximated as
