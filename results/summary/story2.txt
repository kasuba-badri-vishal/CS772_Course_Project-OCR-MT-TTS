"Baby, come for breakfast. Your milk is getting"
"Papa! I don't have to go to school, it's a holiday. Do you have a holiday, too?"
"No, my dear child, I don't have a holiday today. You go and play while I talk to Mr. Singh"
I was the youngest child in the family and received everyone's attention and showing off.
I swung on the curtain, thumped on the door, tapped on the table, pulled and pushed the chair.
Papa of course, was the most Iran from one end of the verandah to the other.
"Baby, be careful, you'll fall down," he said. "Look, Papa, I am taller than everyone," I grinned from ear to ear making my eyes disappear.
Papa did not look convinced. So I said again raising my hands above my head.
'No, you should not touch it.' I was imagining what my mother would tot the patient.
'If you touch it, you'll get hurt,' Bhaiya had told me once. This was a forbidden' article for me, but how attractive it looked black against the light blue wall.
OG looked at Papa with large anxious eyes, but he was busy writing. He did not see me.
I looked at Papa again and then at the switch which begged my hands to touch it again. T1l do it just once more, okay?'
I repeated the mischief once more and was unable to stop myself from doing it again and again.
"Baby, come here, let Papa do his work," called my brother.
Ij jumped down from the table with a loud thud and raced up and down the balcony. My breath quickened, my face went red with anger, and my eyes felt hot with unshed tears.
Bhaiya's fury finds a ready victim and she runs towards him and pushes him.
I rushed and pulled at the curtain in Papa's room, which came down with the force.
Papa patted my head lovingly and wiped my tears.
