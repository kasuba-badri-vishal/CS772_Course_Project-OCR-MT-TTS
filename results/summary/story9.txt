I was in class VIII and a boarder in a Delhi school. I was a good singer and there were hardly any school functions at which I did not recite a poem or sing a song.
I didn't tell you that my hair was rather long in those days. Sometimes my parents would be angry with me on that account.
I thought I would have the freedom of growing my hair as long as I wanted.
The warden, a venerable old fellow, was stricter than my parents.
Every Sunday, an old barber whom we called Khalifaficame to the hostel.
I presented my head to Khalifaji humbly. I even asked him to shave off my head completely!
It took ten minutes to shave my head thrice.
The warden ran out of the classroom and stood stunned as he watched.

1 was of course not permitted to appear on stage the next day.
After that nobody ever asked me to have a haircut again, and today I am the sole master of my head and hair!
