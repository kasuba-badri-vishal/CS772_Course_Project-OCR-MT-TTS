Dasharatha is the King of Ayodhya and has three wives and four sons, Rama Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughana. Rama is the ideal and perfect son and grows up with his brothers.
When he comes of age, he marries Sita, the princess of a nearby kingdom.
However, Bharata's mother is Kaikeyi, who resents Rama being the crown prince.
Kaikeyi calls up a debt that Dasharatha owes her and asks for Rama to be exiled for fourteen years and her son Bharata to be made crown prince instead.
